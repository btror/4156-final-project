Great controller for PC,5.0,"The controller works great with PC. However, out of the box the Bluetooth feature does not play well with Steam. In order to get it to work, there are a few steps you’ll have to do.1. Download the Xbox Accessory App on the Microsoft store.2. Connect the controller with a USB-C cable3. Update the controller4. Pair with windows Bluetooth devices5. Start steam and it should recognize it as Xbox Series X/One controller.5(a). If you paired it before doing these steps (like me). Follow steps 1-3, then go to “Bluetooth devices” remove the device and repair it. Then it should work with no issue.Build: The controller itself is very sturdy and has nice textured grips on the back as well as the triggers. Size is pretty similar to previous Xbox controllers.Battery: I can’t really comment on battery life since I just got it but I would imagine many of you will have some form of rechargeable battery.Wireless: I haven’t had any issues since pairing it nor experience any types of interference with my other wireless peripherals. The range seems good, I’m roughly 15ft away from my TV/desktop.Overall, it’s a much better controller then my ps4 controller. It plays well with Windows 10 as one would hope and once setup with Steam the buttons are automatically mapped.",positive
Finally playing pc games with a controller (:,5.0,"For PC players, you DO NOT need to buy the wireless adapter if you already have a blutooth dongle or blutooth capabilities for your PC.All you need to do is download the Xbox accessories app, turn on your controller and hit the blutooth button on the controller so your PC can find it. Afterwards, open up your blutooth settings in windows to add it as a new blutooth device and you're all set up.I've used the Xbox accessories app to test out if all the buttons work and they're all working properly. So far I've played Yakuza 0 and Ghostrunner with it and haven't had any problems.If you don't have batteries, the controller can be powered by a USB-C cable which is nice.",positive
A more refined Xbox controller,5.0,"This review is for the new ""Shock Blue"" variant of the Xbox controller that launched alongside the Xbox Series X/S.Aesthetically, I love the blue color and white back. This is a good looking controller. But let's be honest, you barely will look at it once you start gaming, so...Xbox controllers have not changed much since the days of the Xbox 360. They have instead gone through minor iterational improvements, and that is no different here. This new controller looks and functions nearly the same as the Xbox One controller, other than the new ""Share"" button in the middle and a switch from micro-USB to USB-C. It still has the 3.5mm headset jack, accessory port for keypads and older headsets, and runs on AA batteries.The main differences are the feel of the controller itself and the D-pad. It now has a lot more textured feeling, which extends to the bumpers and triggers. The bumpers used to be glossy and slippery and now they're more of a matte finish. The D-pad returns to the more ""paddle"" like one from the Xbox 360 but is much improved from that version and feels tight and clicky instead of wobbly. It's similar to the paddle D-pad on the Elite Series 2, if you've seen those. The controller also feels ever so slightly smaller in the hand. Just barely, but something about it feels just a smidge different than the previous generation. The Share button also makes it easier to save gameplay clips and whatnot as well, it's essentially just a shortcut from pressing the Xbox button and manually navigating to share settings.This thing works with all Xbox One/S/X consoles and Xbox Series X/S, as well as PC and bluetooth devices. So it has a lot of versatility. It works great out of the box and I adjusted to it right away coming from Xbox One controllers. Again, it's barely different, so when I say adjusted to it, I basically just mean I switched to it and that was it!I'm an Xbox fan and I love the controller. In my opinion it is nearly perfect, however I have yet to experience the PS5's haptics, which sound interesting. I have no problem with the AA batteries as they last a long time and you don't need to worry about aging internal batteries. That being said, if you've had issues with Xbox controllers in the past, this iteration will not change your mind.",positive
not what I was expecting,1.0,"for the price I did not expect to get a wireless controller that runs on batteries. I was expecting a charging cable. Something that comes standard at this price point with PS4 controllers.Silly me I thought xbox microsoft, windows 10 microsoft...should play nice together right? No. it pairs easily enough but is dead as a doornail with regard to games that support the xbox controller.Hopefully I can find an affordable USB-C cable and then MAYBE it will work but Im doubtful.Also even without the batteries this controller is way heavier than the PS4 controller.I just have just purchased a third party cheapo instead of this over priced thing.",negative
PC Users: You have to buy the wireless adapter separately.,4.0,"Pictured: The Robot White controller (it looks great) next to the Wireless Adapter (not included).Wanted to finally upgrade my Xbox 360 controller to something new for playing PC games. I like the new controller- the textured back feels great on the hands, the d-pad and the shoulder bumpers are clicky in all the ways I like, and they feel nice in my wide palmed, short fingered lady hands. When using the official Wireless Adapter (not bootlegged, link below) it connected easily to my Windows 10 machine. However, therein lies the problem: you need to spend the extra /$25/, on top of the $60 price for the controller, to connect it to a non-bluetooth PC.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZB7W4QUIMO a wired USB cable should've been packed with the controller at the very least. The controller is great, but the $85 price tag (for PC users) really hurts. I can't say I recommend this comfortably to a friend for that kind of price.",positive
Update - very pleased with this controller,4.0,"It's a slight revision to the Xbox family of controllers, so nothing groundbreaking here. The texture on the grips is pleasant, and most everything feels good. While I would have preferred a built-in battery, the battery life seems really good with rechargeable batteries. My biggest complaint stems from the very clicky d-pad. It works well enough, but it's very loud.Also, if you're buying this for a PC, note that this caused a lot of frustration to get working with my PC initially. I had to do a firmware upgrade to the controller (no cable included), and I had to do a system update on Windows, but an issue with SSD compatibility initially prevented me from getting the latest version. Apparently my Bluetooth adapter, which I had used in the past with the Switch Pro and DS4 controllers, was dying. Replacing the adapter and installing updated everywhere got the controller working.",positive
"If you liked the One X controller, you'll like the Series X!",5.0,"I like all the changes they made to the new controller. This review is by a PC gamer, I've never actually had an Xbox.-The triggers are a matte hard rubber black texture with small bumps. They are much easier to press down and the texture feels way better. The One X had weird slippery plastic bumpers and triggers that made games that use the bumpers a lot (for example, Dark Souls) a bit less comfortable than a PS controller. The bumper feedback is much more of a deep bump than the plasticy click of the old controller and I like it.-The grips have a micro-texture as well which makes that controller less slippery in that aspect as well.-The circular directional pad with raised arrows are very clicky, much louder than the One X directional cross. Most games just use the directional buttons for activating items, menus, etc. However I am not much of a fighting game player so I would read other reviews who might have stronger feelings about this change.-Type-C cable instead of micro-USB. That means faster charging if you buy the optional rechargeable battery pack.-The controller is a tiny bit heavier, and feels solid. My old One X controller squeeks and crackles a little bit if I squeeze the controller, the Series X makes no audible noise from strongly squeezing the grips. I would say the build quality got an upgrade, but we will have to see if that lasts with age/use.So yeah, i'd say it's a straight upgrade, but it's not so different that you need to rush out and buy a new one right away.****Weird note! For whatever reason the controller had all kinds of small dust particles on the outside, fresh from the sealed box. I don't know why that was, but it came right off so it might just be a warehouse thing.",positive
"Nice updated controller, but no cable included",3.0,"Compared to the original controller this has new textured patterns on the sides and triggers. The d pad feels much better as well, NOTE controller charging was changed to USB Type C and requires an update upon start up and NO type C cable is included",neutral
Almost Perfect Edit: Fixed,5.0,Works great on steam games and other applications wired. Also the new feel of the controller is amazing. I've never liked Xbox controllers before but this one is amazing in feelings and fit. It would be 5 stars if the Bluetooth worked. Its responsive but the LT and RT don't register in Bluetooth. When that gets fixed with drivers or updates easy 5 star.Edit: As I said once they did the updates it would be 5 stars. They did it pretty quickly like it was out before I even noticed,positive
Best PC Gaming Controller for Windows,5.0,"I haven't owned an Xbox since the 360, but I had been using the USB 360 controller for PC gaming since then. That controller recently gave out on me when the connection between the cord and the controller failed. I was then using a PS4 controller to hold me over until this controller came out. The PS4 controller works OK, but I never liked micro USB connectors. The connector on the PS4 controller also started to fail, so it disconnected easily when I moved. It also doesn't have Xinput (Microsoft's controller API) support like the Xbox controllers do. Because of Xinput, most games are automatically configured correctly to recognize the Xbox controller (any of them, not just this model), so I couldn't wait to get back to an Xbox controller.Another (maybe weird?) thing about me is that I don't like wireless controllers. It's annoying to change or recharge batteries when the controller just permanently sits within wired distance of my PC anyway. I've had wireless controllers in the past that I couldn't use without the battery pack inserted, but this one works great with just a USB cable and no batteries. I also like the fact that it uses regular AA batteries, and not a proprietary battery pack. I also love the USB-C connector and have been eagerly waiting for more controllers to have them. USB-C feels less prone to failure than micro USB.These may be strange things to talk about as opposed to how the controller actually feels, but most people already know what to expect from an Xbox controller as it hasn't changed that much. I wanted to add a few points that stood out to me personally. It would have been nice for them to throw in a USB-C cable, but other than that I love everything about it so far.",positive
Y button is unresponsive at times,2.0,"I ordered 2 controllers, and on both of them, the Y button needs a lot of pressure to register an input. I play with my thumb across the A/X/Y button so the pressure will be placed unevenly but at times the Y button doesn't get input.  I didn't have this issue with the Xbox 360/One controller. Was looking forward to having the textured grips. Getting replacements and will see what happens with that.EDIT: Afte receiving the replacement controllers, it seems this is a structural flaw with how it is built. Y button on both of them has the same issue. Wouldn't recommend buying if you press buttons lightly. Otherwise, a nice controller but this is a deal-breaker for me.",negative
Hold off - wait for iOS compatibility and drivers,1.0,"I had hoped for 100% compatibility with the XBOX one wireless controller. It's not exactly interchangeable with the XBOX One Wireless controller. Some software may not work, even on Windows 10.It pairs with iOS, but it didn't response at all for any games. Awaiting support for this controller on iOS.",negative
"Great update on the Xbox controller, but things to know before buying...",5.0,"2020 has been a year chock full o’ disappointment, chaos & being tethered to the home which means more time planted on the sofa, like a bump on a log, grinding out time by playing video games & having the controllers get wonky in record time.  I wasn’t looking to buy the newer model controllers & simply wanted to replace the original style, but as they’re apparently discontinued, I’m darned glad I did, as they are seemingly more comfortable & responsive. After shelling out just $10 less than what I paid for this one for a refurbished controller from GameStop (who are using trash tier parts to fix the exchanged ones), I found myself having to get this new model.  I like using a Kontrol Freek Extender on the R thumbstick & a concave silicone cover on the L, but w/ the refurbished ones, they’re using thumstick replacements that are just a millimeter or 2 too small for the KF extenders & silicone covers.  Without any thumbstick extender/cover, GS’s cheapo replacements just feel weird & made game play awful.  Don’t get me started on how bad the buttons were as it’s infuriating enough to make you want to punch puppies!  This new controller, as I said, is crazy comfortable & I swear the buttons respond better.  The sharing button is pretty helpful too & as everyone & their mother is uploading videos or streaming their gameplay, it’s a right handy little addition.  I’ve only used this for a few games, mostly for RDR2, but it definitely helped me to have that better, more comfy feel & responsiveness.  Now for the downside: the Xbox “brand” & “off brand” rechargeable batteries are NOT working in it for me.  To charge & connect these new controllers, you must have the newest USB-C cords!  (Plenty of good deals are to be had here on Amazon for them.  I got 2 10’, gold plated cords for $10)  So that I am not ripping through conventional AA batteries, I have my USB-C cord plugged into a charger next to my couch.  While I’m guessing Xbox is either needing to do some sort of update to make the old rechargeable batteries work in these, I’d bet dollars to doughnuts that they’re going to put out a new battery & cord combo for these.  If you absolutely abhor using cords but don’t want to rip through batteries, invest in rechargeable AA ones until they sort out why the rechargeable battery packs aren’t working or come out w/ new ones.  To make sure it wasn’t just my getting a faulty controller, a friend had also gotten one of these & have the same problem w/ not having the Xbox One rechargeable battery pack work in theirs.  Aside from this, I can find nothing else negative about these & if you’re another “grinder” needing an upgrade to a controller that has drifting & having to mash the buttons to have them register, or a trigger or bumped button went on the wonk; I’m assured in my telling you to invest in one of these.  I’m hoping the USB-C cord won’t develop the loosening up that the original micro-USB cords are notorious for.  For those looking for a TL; DR version of my endless drivel, these new controllers are:More comfortableMore responsiveNeed a USB-C cordDon’t work w/ Xbox nor offbrand rechargeable battery packs so get rechargeable AA batteries if you don’t want to be tethered.",positive
Shipped without any Protection,2.0,"They shipped mine without any actual packaging, just slapped a label on the box itself. What is this? The controller must've gotten damaged on the way as a result, because it won't stop vibrating randomly even when I'm not playing any games and after I updated it. I've yet to test it on the Xbox, since I do most of my gaming on PC, but I have to say this is really disappointing, because the design and build of the controller itself is really pretty and feels nice to the touch. Would be great if Amazon shipped these like they're worth more than $60.",negative
Super High Build Quality Feel For New Series X/S Controllers,5.0,"I was surprised at just how heavy, and super high quality the Series X controller feels as I know it looks almost identical to the Xbox one controllers but it doesn’t feel the same at all as the New Series X controller oozes high quality as it’s got a lot of weight which makes me think the internals have been beefed up a bit despite the outer shell looking similar to last generations pad !The New Textures Feel Amazing as this thing really is so premium feeling in every meaningful way as the only thing I would’ve like too see was for Microsoft to have included two back buttons similar to the ones on the cheaper power a 3rd party controllers as it feels so natural to use the back buttons instead of the top Rb / Lb buttons as that’s the single complaint I have which i think Microsoft could’ve done because the cheaper power a pads have those two buttons, and it makes playing game’s so much easier, however maybe Microsoft didn’t wanna cannibalize sales of their Elite V2 which could explain the lack of back buttons on the standard Series X controller but regardless it should’ve had those, and it would be absolutely Perfect !Also The Shock Blue looks so amazing in person as it’s much better than the pictures portray as ya gotta have it in order to really appreciate itFyi,The Regular Xbox One Controllers always felt very cheap as they didn’t feel as though the quality was high at all, and the thumb stick modules were cheap plastic which caused so many broken thumb sticks, and or thumb stick drift, etc as they was terrible, and so that makes Me appreciate the Higher Quality Feel of The New Series X/S controllers even more as they’re Awesome",positive
A good iteration on the Xbox One controller.,5.0,"This is just the Xbox one controller with a few much needed quality of life changes, USB-C instead of Micro USB, Better texture on the handles, Grippy triggers, Built in Bluetooth, And a new D-Pad.It's not as flashy and new as the DualSense, But you don't need to reinvent perfection.",positive
Loud buttons,3.0,"Overall the controller feels a bit more sturdy than previous controllers but time will tell. Every other xbox controller has failed me after a year or so and of course they don't replace them under warranty.My reason for 3/5 stars is because most of the buttons are unnecessarily loud. YXBA buttons and the D-pad are just really annoying. I don't understand why they would do this. The feedback is good but all the clicking is just a huge turnoff. Playing RDR2 for example, when you have to constantly tap A to ride your horse gets old after a while and it's even worse with a loud button.I may end up returning it but it might be fine for driving games where you're using the triggers a lot more than the other buttons. Really disappointing.",neutral
Best console controller to date!,5.0,"This is definitely an upgrade from the XB1 controller in terms of both ergonomics and button response.  The D-pad is very responsive with a satisfying mechanical feel and is faster and more responsive than the XB1 controller.The overall feel is a bit more compact than the XB1 controller which allows you to reach the middle buttons (including the new share button) faster and more easily.  The textured grip on the shoulder button and triggers was something I never knew I needed.  Smart design idea there.My only gripe is that I prefer the rubberized grip of the premium XB1 controllers to the textured grip, but it is still another improvement over the XB1 textured grip.  Definitely helps prevent slip during long gaming sessions.Barring the elite controller, this is hands-down my favorite controller for any console to date.  Well done, Microsoft!",positive
Awesome!,5.0,Feels nice and sleek. Good packaging and came with batteries! (:,positive
"Not quite an upgrade, barley functioning on PC",2.0,"It's a good controller, but it feels like they took both a step forward and back from the Xbox One controller. Also, controls through Bluetooth are jumbled up in some games.Pros:- The Xbox controller design and layout. It's still as great as ever.- The redesigned D-pad is easier to use.- The controller is a tiny bit smaller and feels much better sized in my hands.- They replaced the shiny black texture on the bumpers and triggers with a better matte texture.- The menu buttons feel more clicky and are more responsive.Cons:- Controls are straight up broken in some games when the controller is connected through Bluetooth. They get all jumbled up, like A becomes X, B becomes A, and RT becomes the start button. It works normally when connected through a cable or the Xbox Wireless Adapter. I don't know what the problem is, but they need to fix this ASAP. It's been a while since release and there still has been no recognition of this problem.- You need to update the firmware to use it on Bluetooth. You need a cable or the Xbox Wireless Adapter to update the firmware. The controller comes with neither.- The grip textures are irritating on my hands. It feels like you're holding a man's bearded face. I don't understand why they had to ruin the controller like this. All they had to do was keep it smooth.- The buttons, including the D-pad, are significantly louder than the Xbox One controller.- The share button does nothing on PC.I recommend holding off on this controller until they fix the Bluetooth issue at least. The grip textures ruin the controller for me personally. The Xbox One controller is still available and a much better option at this point. If you still have an Xbox One controller, there is no reason for you to get this one.",negative
Feels Great To Hold,5.0,Looks great and feels good to hold! No problems out the box so far. Very similar to the regular Xbox One controller. The textured grip feels nice. It also comes with a 2 week gamepass ultimate code.,positive
DON'T BUY!,1.0,Already on my 2nd one and both disconnect constantly from Xbox One.,negative
Keeps disconnecting - possible fake.,1.0,"Hooking up to PC, the only way to keep a connection is to use a USB-C connection. Otherwise using the XBOX toggle, it disconnects. Using Bluetooth on the pc disconnects. Randomly. Tried firmware update, and that helped slightly. Meaning that I didn't have to completely unplug the batteries to reconnect the system.That's where the possible fake comes in. Mine didn't come with the ""Hello From Seattle"". The battery doesn't support the normal battery packs.",negative
Not backwards compatible with previous Xbox chargers,2.0,"Just learned they changed the plug for the controller and it does not work with previous Xbox One or One X charging cables. When advertising it's ""compatible"" with previous gaming systems, maybe let the customer know their Xbox rechargeable battery system will not work. The controller doesn't even come with its own cable either. Pretty poor to not include a $2 cable on a $60+ controller. I give it two stars because the controller is nice, it's just ridiculous to advertise it's backwards compatible when it's not fully backwards compatible and the lack of a cable is unforgivable.",negative
Bad design choice leads to inevitable sticky right trigger. 2nd controller in a month!,1.0,"It's official: Microsoft has ruined and/or killed the xbox controller. This is my 2nd controller I've purchased in 2 months. Even though this is my first day using it, and it is in fact brand new, I can already tell it will suffer the same problem as my other two xbox one (usb type c) controllers. There is a small foam strip about half an inch in size that is cheaply glued underneath the Right Trigger in order to help ""dampen"" the trigger pull and prevent the trigger mechanism from hitting the plastic and prevent noise. It took all but 3 weeks for that strip to eventually semi-rip off and fall into my hand while playing a game. My previous controller took 2 months. I give this one a month as well, considering it already feels like the pad is coming off.Is there a remedy? Yes. But, guess what? Microsoft made these newer controllers much harder to open up, unlike the xbox 360 controller. Now instead of removing a couple of screws with a very common inexpensive tip, you have to essentially almost break your controller case open via prying it open. Then pray you don't break anything inside. Then you need to remove whats left of the foam and vigorously clean the glue off. While that worked for my previous controller, the left joystick started having registration issues a week later making it unusable for either single player or multiplayer games.The only game I use this for is Rocket League on PC, and when this controller starts having issues like the ones stated then it is unusable. The build quality of these newer controllers is abysmal and it's actually insane that this is Microsofts standard for quality now. I aggressively used xbox 360 controllers for much much longer and the rubber pads for the buttons would wear out before anything else did. I take excellent care of my gear across the board, these controllers were never dropped or abused.My advice to you is: avoid like the plague. Buy new old stock. This is just not worth the money anymore and the controller WILL break.Update: I can't believe it, but it already sticks!!!! I suspect this controller was subjected to high heat and melted the glue holding said piece of cheap thin foam. Returned...",negative
Constantly disconnects with xbox one console.,1.0,"I am on my second core controller for my xbox one in 2 days and they both keep disconnecting every 3 seconds, then connects, then disconnects over and over again.  I updated both with the latest firmware and still does not cure anything. If I connect via USB it works fine. I would have figured this controller would work with my xbox considering it says on the box it will and it's from MICROSOFT....but I guess not. I will be returning both and will continue to use my old POS drifting junk xbox controller for now.",negative
"I wanted to like it, but maybe mine is defective... Update Amazing!!!",5.0,"I am upgrading from the Razer Wolverine TE. Yeah, upgrading. I say that because the Razer gave me horrible blisters to use even on a light basis....weekend gaming. I got this one and the dang right trigger sticks. Makes rocket league (the main reason I got this) unplayable. Sending in for a replacement hoping it is better. The left trigger does not behave this way so I'm hopeful. I'll update the rating if so. Otherwise this thing is slickkkkEdit: Received the replacement and a second controller for my wife. The trigger sticking issue is not present on either one of these controllers so I've updated my rating to 5 stars.  Major kudos to both Microsoft and Amazon for the 2 day replacement.",positive

WTH!!! How can that be possible if the controller is NEW!!??? I'm not happy about this at all!!",negative
Won’t fit you rechargeable battery packs.,1.0,I bought this Xbox controller and an Xbox Rechargeable batteries but this is the only Xbox controller out of 5 that I have that doesn’t fit it. Beautiful controller color  but super frustrating to buy an expensive controller for it to make me also constantly have to buy batteries for when I’ve already Bought an accessory to avoid that through Xbox/Microsoft. Not happy tbh. Would return but my bf likes the color so I’m tryna be chill but SUPER ANNOYING....,negative
battery door not backward compatable,3.0,"Great joystick, though keep hitting snapshot button by accident. Will have to look into disabling that.  Also the battery door is not backward compatible with the previous model, so any rechargeable battery packs you have won't work with it. You will have to get new ones that are compatible with this version of the controller. So these two reasons are why I  did not give it  5 stars...",neutral
Beware,1.0,I got it and when I turned it on it seems to have a burn mark or black smudge behind the X logo,negative
"It's cool, buuuut...",4.0,"It's a beautiful controller, honestly. The blue is a bit more vibrant online than in person, but I still love it. My issue is that the box is came in was pretty ripped up and damaged. I got this as a gift, so I'll have to find anothrt box to give it in. Oh well.",positive
Upgraded Xbox controller,3.0,"It’s the Xbox controller you know and love, with some minor upgrades. Grip, trigger, and stick textures give it more grip and feels good. Lower latency wireless which most will not even notice, and a dedicated share button. Works great with PC using the existing Xbox wireless controller USB adapter. Required a windows update, Xbox accessories app update, and controller firmware update to get it all set up and working properly. As of right now, the share button does not work on the PC with Xbox game bar. There is no way to map the function manually either. I assume support for this button and screenshots will be added in a future update. Quick screenshots would be nice. Controller will be 5 star once fully functional with PC.",neutral
Doesn't stay connected wirelessly.,1.0,"Do not buy!0/5 stars.Doesn't stay connected, so forced to stay hardwired. So now I've got a battery pack I can't use, and I've got to stay tethered to my console like it's 1982. Console update and controller update didn't help. It's actually gotten worse since then.Oh, and then Amazon immediately put it on a huge sale right after the rest of us paid full price pre-ordering something that doesn't even work properly. Awesome.",negative
This controller has known connectivity issues that Microsoft is ignoring.,1.0,"I bought this controller to replace an Xbox one controller. It constantly disconnects even when plugged into the Xbox one with a USB wire. I've been waiting for a fix from Microsoft but it seems they haven't even admitted that there is a problem. The firmware has been completely updated and I tried all the ""fixes"" that I could find on the internet which basically consisted of making sure your controller is updated and doing a hard reboot on your Xbox. I would wait to buy this controller until this issue is fixed. It's fair to say I was disappointed but not terribly surprised with how low Xbox controller quality seems to be. I will update this review and gladly change the star rating if this gets resolved in a timely manner.",negative
No rechargeable battery pack = USELESS. STAY AWAY!,1.0,Is not capable of recharging. Comes with AA batteries and not rechargeable like every controller for the last 20 years. DO NOT BUY,negative
Defective. Constantly disconnecting and recounting.,1.0,Defective product. Controller would connect to xbox but would constantly discount and recount for no reason many times. DON'T BUY!!!,negative
Sticky buttons - not new- arrived late,1.0,"The item arrived late which isn't the biggest deal to me... things happen I get it. but when I opened the package, the item which I purchased as a new item had the security sticker tampered with. It looked like it was peeled up and then re-stuck to the packaging . After this I figured that I would give the item a try and if it was alright I would just deal with whatever I had received. When I played one game I instantly felt the keys were sticky the RT button would stick down after pressing and the ""X"" button would also stick and lag when coming up or it would be difficult to press. I am very un-happy with this item and I am in the process of returning it. I decided to go to the Microsoft web store to purchase two new controllers since it is the same price and hopefully will be better quality than this hot garbage that I received. The only positive thing was the color was vibrant and decent looking. Hope this review helps steer you clear and to go with a better product",negative
An (almost) perfect reimagining,5.0,"Although there's been a lot of buzz (and rightfully so) around the new Dualsense PS5 controller, Microsoft decided to take a very different approach from Sony; meaningful, iterative improvements to an already solid base. The first version I ever used, model 1697, was the best controller I had ever used up to that point. It was the primary reason I switched from my XB360, as I was unable to pair it with the console, but the controller was too good to go back. Clicky, responsive buttons, lighter weight, easily accessible battery door, good battery life, solid accuracy and excellent haptic feedback in the triggers made me fall in love. Jump to the next model, the 1708, and all those things remained, but there was a different finish and now the awesome addition of Bluetooth. This has been the controller I've used on console and PC for the better part of 5 straight years. I've even tried to pair it with a couple Sony systems to experience some of the better games exclusive to that platform (I was unsuccessful BTW). Now, introduce this model, the 1914, and I feel like it's 2 steps forward and a step backwards. The D-Pad is outrageously good and responsive, the trigger texturing gives a more involved feel, the matte finish makes it less vulnerable to oils or greases making it slippery and the battery door redesign is a very slight but meaningful touch. Even the added feature of showing the battery level on PC is a tiny detail that shows the thoughtfulness that went into crafting this. The only reason this is not a 5 is the connectivity. Full disclosure, this is primarily used with a PC in this use case, and as such, you WILL need the XBox accessories app, as I needed to apply an update fresh out the box. The Bluetooth connection on my 1708 literally never dropped out in my entire memory of use. Extremely strong, very dependable and no lag to speak of. The 1914, not so much. There's been no observable lag, and when it works, it's easily better, but the connection is very spotty. As mentioned, an update was necessary right out of the box, and performance marginally improved, but as it stands, during a 3 hr play session last night it lost connection at least 10 times, with the Xbox light blinking a few times and going solid again roughly every 20 mins or so. I tried multiple games, including very tight shooters and it's the same thing; excellent performance when it's working, a temporary drop for no more than 5 seconds, then back to working as if nothing happened. I've already gone the driver route of making sure everything is updated correctly, but this seems to be more a 1914 problem, as the 1708 has never had this problem with a console or 3 different PCs with 3 different Bluetooth adapters. Funny though, a wireless adapter is available, and is touted as the primary way to connect without a USB cable (the USB cable does work flawlessly BTW). Of course, there is a fee for this adapter, which makes me feel like this is the classic create a problem, sell the solution sort of scenario, which has soured my experience greatly here. This is a relatively new device, having only been on the market for a little over a month at the time of this writing, so it's definitely possible for this issue to be resolved, but there's currently no discount for this unit, so you're being asked the complete price for an incomplete experience for the time being. Once (if) this issue is resolved, I will absolutely change this to a 5, but right now, with the drops, it's a mediocre purchase at best, with the 1708 currently being a better option, and at a lesser price. Best of luck.Edit: In order to have the update applied, you must FIRST connect to the PC with your USB-C and use the Xbox accessories app to update, then, most importantly, you must UNPAIR the controller if it was previously paired. If it's the first time pairing, it won't be an issue, but if you previously were paired before the update, it will not apply. After following these steps, I can confidently report all connection issues have been fixed, and there have been no Bluetooth drops to speak of. This is now a 5 star device.",positive
Its a good controller but theres still some technical flaws with the bluetooth connectivity,4.0,"I dont have an Xbox Series X yet but i did need a new controller for my PC so I got one of these to kind of future proof myself and have the extra controller.Its got nice feedback meaning the clicks of the buttons especially the bumpers are a bit more satisfying than the previous xbox one model.  Its weighted a little better.  A bit more balanced which should lead to less drops, which is good because I kept destroying my bumper buttons when the old controllers dropped.It doesnt connect with my windows 10 PC via bluetooth as smoothly as the xbox one version of the controller does.  And yes I updated it first by plugging it in.  And no it doesnt come with a cable so if youre using it for PC and dont have a USB A to USB C cable youll need one.  And i mean need.  Because even after the firmware update connectivity is a little fussy I cant imagine what its like without it.It doesnt quite ""plug and play"" intuitively like the previous model does with PC.  The last one i just plugged it in once to update the firmware, had it paired via bluetooth, and never had a problem.  With this one I get random (albeit brief) disconnects or other random problems.  For instance when I was playing Madden earlier the game thought I had two controllers plugged in (yes I removed all controllers from my PC via bluetooth) which prevented me from playing my franchise mode properly. Nothing a quick restart couldnt fix but... i never had to restart my computer because the xbox one controller had issues.If i had to do it all over again I would have bought the xbox one version.  For one it works better with PC which is what im using it for and also it comes with a cable which this does not.  I see people bagging on the replaceable battery being a problem instead of an internal one.  I cant say I disagree but i have about 20 rechargable AAs running through my household at any time so this is zero problem for me.  It may be for you so I thought id mention it.",positive
Makes games completely unplayable,1.0,"The controller is solid and the buttons are great but it doesn’t work. It frequently disconnects itself, even making games unplayable by doing so. Microsoft’s advice was to connect it to the console ... which defeats the purpose of a wireless controller and shouldn’t be necessary. It’s a flawed product and likely was rushed to launch.",negative
Constantly Disconnecting,1.0,"I bought this to replace the controller that my roommate broke, I was happy with it for all of 30 minutes. I love the texturing  on this controller, it feels great in your hand. I also like the screenshot button.Now for the downside: It constantly disconnects while playing. I know it isn't something weird with my system as my other controller is doing just fine. Also, it runs on batteries. There's no rechargeable pack- it can't even fit the rechargeable packs from my other controller because the shape of the controller is different. I expected more for paying like $16 more than my previous controller.I'll be returning this.",negative
controller is great box it came in wasn't,4.0,Controller is fine but it looks like someone ripped open the side of the box 📦 at Amazon not cool. Would get 5 stars if not for that,positive
It just stops working after a week!,1.0,"I NEVER DROPPED IT AND ITS NOT WORKING. It’s just giving a faint flash and not turning on. I connected it to a wire , and even bought two packs of batteries and it doesn’t work! I paid 60$ for this new and it’s not working ! For Microsoft this is a Horrible control. I love it at first. But it don’t work! I heard the same bout the Xbox series x ! Unbelievable!",negative
A great upgrade from the Xbox One controller.,4.0,"This is a very nice upgrade from the original xbox one controller.- If you connect this to your PC via a Bluetooth adapter you can actually run this while plugged into a wall. As far as I know this was not the case with the original controller as I've tried it before. So I can have this plugged into my phone charger without batteries and it will still be connected to my pc.Pros:- The texture on the back and sides is very nice, it really grips your heands.- Even though it's all plastic, it feels very nice to the touch.- USB Type C finally.- The shape of the DPad makes it very easy to recognize what direction you are pressing and the tactile feedback makes it easy to know when you've pressed it, more on that later.- The triggers are shorter and less curved so it fits my large hands better.And all the other pros of the original xbox one controller.Cons:- The grips on the trigger feel very nice, but I'm not sure they are useful, my fingers can still slide off them every now and then.- While the shape of the DPad is nice, the tactile click is not. It's way too loud and just not satisfying to press. It's so loud I can hear it over the fan in my room, through my noise cancelling Corsair headset while it's underneath my desk. The noise just feels cheap.- This is minor but the analog triggers need to be pressed down more to get the same result as the original controller. It's most noticeable in Forza Horizon 4. In order to rev to 5000rpm on a car I need to press it down like 90% of the way. Compared to the original controller which I only needed to press down about 50% of the way.",positive
Awesome,5.0,It’s a really nice controller,positive
A step up.,5.0,Controller feels great in the hands and has a nice rubber grip on the back. Weighted better than the previous iteration and more premium.  New d-pad and share button are nice additions.Can’t go wrong with this color.,positive
"Constantly disconnects, even after firmware updates",1.0,Junk.  Constantly disconnects from Xbox One.  And I mean like every 2 seconds.  No exaggeration.,negative
"New and better, but broke just the same.",1.0,"Lasts about 30 days until noticible degradation (stick drift and now stick sticking in the latest model!). Don't play Rocket League with this unless you can afford to replace frequently. Awesome for general rpg and fps gaming and anything less demanding than that... in my experience. (With Xbox subscriptions we ought to get replacement controllers gratis to keep our patronage, imo) This version definitely feels better to use than the last version, but remains equally as disposable.",negative
Best Controller On Market,5.0,"I do not have a preference for brands but try to go with what is best available for PC racing use. I do not have room for a wheel. It's either this or Sony. They both make great consoles and invest millions into their controllers. Bluetooth works fine just update it when you get it.  This is smaller and the grips feel great. I have reasonably big man hands so the previous xbone controller was too big. I use LB/RB to shift in games and the improvement is very nice. I don't have to move my finger from the triggers to bumpers at all, can just lay the upper index fingers on the bumpers. The original version of  the previous model I could not do this at all, the bumpers were awful and clicky. Then they updated it and it worked well enough. Now it's prefect. I hope it is more durable than the previous model. My issue was usually sticking triggers.I've seen a few criticisms that I do not understand:""For the price I did not expect to get a wireless controller that runs on batteries. I was expecting a charging cable.""Under product info it says ""2 AA batteries required. (included).""""Hopefully I can find an affordable USB-C cable and then maybe it will work""This is $3: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089LWHZ4B/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_H.a5FbXY08S2E""It is heavy""Yes at 15.7 ounces it is about twice as heavy as a DualShock. Batteries make it heavier. Lithiums help. My Energizer Max AA's together weigh 1.6 ounces. I think of it as a one pound weight during gameplay which is especially important during the pandemic. I also like the DualShock I am not attacking the DuakShock. Third-party have all stunk from PS2 on in my opinion.",positive
You need to update to the newest version of Windows 10 if you're having problems,5.0,"I love this controller.Grip feels better, feels slightly more compact and heavier than the last controller. Buttons are slightly clicky, but less so than say, a Nintendo Joycon.I ran into one issue initially, when connecting via Bluetooth, Windows only recognized it as a ""D-Input"" controller, and the triggers didn't respond. I applied the firmware update, still nothing.I saw it was recommended to update to the newest version of Windows 10, the 20H2 update. Once I did, the controller shows as an X-Input controller.Not sure if it is just my imagination, but this thing is fast. I could usually perceive the slightest input lag with bluetooth controllers, now it also feels like it's responding a millisecond before I even complete the button press.",positive
So far so good - slightly better XOne controller,5.0,"Only had a couple of days, but enjoying it so far. Sold my Xbox One controller with my console, and using it primarily for PC. Like the Xbox One controller it gets detected fine in Windows/Steam (actually AS a Xbox One controller). The USB-C port is a nice new touch instead of micro USB. Textured grips, triggers, and bumpers feel really good.All buttons feel responsive and good. Kind of lackluster share button for PC and I wish there was an easy way to rebind this.D-pad feels really great and tactile and all buttons have a nice click/activation feel. However the big issue with the D-pad is the noise! It's so clicky and loud. Considering it feels good to use and time might wear out the volume a bit it's not a huge deal to me but I do miss the less annoying D-pad of the controller this replaced.Last thing to note is it actually feels a bit better in hand than the Xbox One controller for smaller hands, not sure what they changed but it's more comfortable for me.Time will tell on durability, volume of buttons, and build quality. First impressions are positive though, not much different than the standard Xbox One/S/X controllers. But the small changes to things like D-pad, textured triggers, USB-C, and other minor changes are a positive in my book.",positive
Scammers wasted my time,1.0,"It was supposed to be brand new in box, it was used and malfunctioning. The controller turns itself off every minute and won't play specific games. It's obviously a factory defect that they thought they could sell on the internet. Scammers like this should be banned from Amazon in my opinion.",negative
CRAPPY QUALITY CONTROL!,1.0,Purchased on 11/20 it is now 2/21...right stick gets stuck when pushing it in and turns the controller off when it does it.For $50 the return window should be at least 6 months? But 4 MONTHS? And for a original Xbox controller they should last longer. The one that came with the console had problems with the head set hook up and bought this one to replace it. THAT controller had head set connectivity issues only after TWO months. AND NO we are not hard on our stuff we are OLD GAMERS! POOR QUALITY CONTROLL!,negative
Worked great... FOR ONLY A MONTH,1.0,"I was extremely happy with this purchase... but only for the first month. Now, only a few days past the allowed Amazon return window, I can't get it to connect via cable anymore. It starts to make the connection and do the confirmation vibration, but then cuts out again in a split second - as if there's some vital connection point inside that somehow became misaligned. I haven't mistreated or dropped the controller at all, and it is safely stored between uses. I've tried multiple other cables, including new ones fresh from the package, but no luck. The brand new cable at least gave me the split second blip that it almost connected. Some older cables didn't even give me that. I've tried plugging the other end to multiple different USB ports, testing every other possible point of failure and ruled them all out. It's got a broken connection inside and now I'm stuck with this dud.While I know it's still in warranty w/ Microsoft, to activate the warranty requires packing up and shipping the controller to them at my own expense, then waiting weeks to get a fixed or otherwise refurbished item back to me. It's ridiculous and I'm so mad that it just happened to fail only a few days past the Amazon return window.",negative
"A little heavy, trigger buttons have a deep press",3.0,"Between Xbox & PS, I’ve always like newer Xbox controllers. This is no exception.The angle of the hands when gripped feels natural. I really enjoy the balanced weight through out the device. And the D-pad & stick movement & range; all top notch.But there are some bads in my opinion that come with all the good. Xbox has traditionally made heavy controllers. Even though the weight distribution is even, the device is quite heavy over all. I honestly don’t care for the PS controller weight either. The Switch Pro Controller is a good weight in my opinion.In addition to the weight, I don’t much care for the trigger buttons. The tactical feel is nice, but the distance to travel when actuating the click makes them less then idea for some games.Those 2 are my biggest gripes. So would I order again, that’s a funny story. After playing a little with my son’s robot white controller, which he loves; we ordered another for myself, but upon arrival, 1 of the shoulder buttons was damaged. Clicks would just miss. So, even looking past the other issues I stated above, fate it seems decide this controller isn’t for me. It’s being sent back and tho my son loves his, we won’t be ordering another. Great for my son, just meh for me.",neutral
**Works with Steam after update,4.0,"The controller itself seems fine and it connects to my PC just fine but it will not be recognized at all on Steam so I have not used it all. Might be worth noting that it also doesn’t work on the Switch if you have an 8BitDo adapter. Overall very disappointing, if you want a controller that actually works you’ll have to try the ps5 controller.11/14/20 EditIt seems that after updating the controller and reconnecting it through Bluetooth, it now works with Steam. Still unclear whether it works with 8bitDo adapter to use on Nintendo Switch but at least it is usable on PC and Steam. You will need a usb-c cable to update the controller though.",positive
Received Defective Controller: Brand New Battery Popped,1.0,"Inserted the batteries that came with the controller, the controller would flash for a second and then turn back off. Thought maybe I just got defective batteries, took them out and they were very hot. Put in a set of my own brand new batteries, same issue happened. Took these batteries out and one was extremely hot. After those batteries sat on my coffee table for a minute, one popped open all of a sudden and leaked battery acid on my coffee table, and caused a burn stain from the hot battery. Hopefully just a random defective controller, I am getting a replacement from Amazon and hoping this one won't have any issues.",negative
Great Controller,5.0,"Very nice controller, paired quickly with my Xbox One S. Was shipped and delivered fast as well. Color looks great, the  new added texture feels great and the update took two minutes max. It feels slightly smaller than the previous Xbox One controller- but it’s a nice change. The new hybrid D-Pad has a nice click and I really like it. One pair of AA batteries are included. I definitely recommend, you won’t be disappointed.",positive
Faulty controllers,1.0,"It was past time to replace old Xbox one controllers do I bought two of these. Straight out of the box I liked them. The problem came when I paired them, they paired easy enough but they constantly turn off and then back on. They do this every few seconds which makes game play impossible.",negative
Turns Off Randomly,1.0,This controller looks and feels nice and is a slight upgrade from the previous controllers. My problem with the controller is that it will turn off at random. I have tried several batteries and different button combinations and there is no pattern. The controller will turn off at key moments in game and is unpredictable. Very unfortunate especially while playing online.,negative
NOT COMPATIBLE WITH XBOX CONSOLE,1.0,"Controller constantly disconnects and will not stay connected. Firmware update does not fix this, and it has happened on 2/2 controllers (got a new one after returning, figured this was manufacturer defect but its designed to be trash) $40 total waste, guess I got what I paid for though. They just want you to buy the elite controller so they get more money to kill 10% of the population by vaccinations (per Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft<Xbox).",negative
"Very ""bluetiful""",5.0,"My husband was jealous of my default Series X controller. It does have a different feel to the last gen's Xbox one design. I think it seems to have a better texture on the top, and the back sides of the controllers. It also has the new share button in the middle, and a nicer DPad. My husband does not have an Xbox, but he does game on his PC oftenly. He has a Dualsense controller from his PS5, and Dualshock ones from his older playstations. He perfers using Xbox Controllers for his PC, since most games use the Xbox button prompt overlay. He was happy with his Xbox one controller, but I wanted him to see just how nice the new imorovents are with the Series X|S generation of controllers. I bought him this controller so he would have the updated design. He told me he was skeptical of the new DPad when he saw my black controller that came with my console.Once he got his, he fell in love with it. He told me how much better it was compared to the Xbox One's controller design. They really do look similar, but once you get to actually feel it for yourself is when you start to realize just how nicer this new design is.The blue controller has a white battery cover, and back. While the top part is blue! The color is very similar to what is shown in the online photos!Anyways, it was the perfect birthday gift for him, and it made him so happy!",positive
My controller is defective.,1.0,"I've started to notice that when I press a button, the function that's supposed to happen doesn't. A considerable amount of force is needed or repeated taps, in order for the function to work. For example, last night I was playing Destiny 2 and I needed to tap the right trigger button 3 times before I could fire my rocket launcher. This has happened before but in the moment, I assumed it was me not pressing the button correctly or hard enough but now I think it's the controller. These are very expensive so I'm not looking for a new controller but if it gets real bad, I may need to.Edit: Things have gotten so bad that I'm now looking for another controller. I'm very disappointed as red is my favorite color and I love the look of the controller but the look means nothing if I'm constantly losing.",negative
Annoying Share Button,2.0,"The placement of the new share button is incredibly annoying. It will CONSTANTLY try to upload game video clips from accidental button presses. This is on top of the controllers overall smaller size being slightly too small for full grown hands.The new share button being dead center between and slightly below the old start and select buttons means it keeps getting accidentally pressed if you have larger hands. When this happens the controller automatically tries to upload a game clip to Xbox Live. This is INCREDIBLY ANNOYING and there is no way to disable this function to keep the controller from trying to upload video clips when the share button is pressed. You can make the function a short or a long press in the controller app but that does not disable accidental uploads.You can also disable uploads in your Xbox Settings menu, but this does not stop the controller itself from trying to upload video clips. You will simply get a pop up notification in the middle of your game that the video clip upload failed. Over and over and over and over again you will see this message pop up in the middle of your game because of accidental share button presses.This new controller is a step down from the old design.",negative
"Using with my Xbox One S: I love this thing, because it's not worn out. Yet.",4.0,"The texture is great; I have always used a skin or grips (and until recently, those were all garbage, IMO, except for Dragon Skinz IINM). I like that the charging port is now USB C, as I can now toss that basket full of micro USB cables. I don't care about the share button, but someone probably loves that. Dpad definitely feels better, but I don't use it much in gameplay.Mainly, I'm happy to have a working controller, and I'm content with this one because of the preorder pricing, quick delivery, and I was able to get a refund for the defective controller I bought a few weeks back. Take one of those factors out of the equation, and it's a lot less attractive purchase.",positive
Breaks incredibly easily,2.0,"I had this controller delivered in mid-November of 2020. It is now February 2nd of 2021 and BOTH of my control sticks drift upward sharply (non-stop input, and if you play smite, picture your camera panning up to your character's butt facing the sky within 2 seconds of you not actively controlling it, while also struggling to recall because your character keeps moving until you finagle the stick into true neutral.)The cause of this? I dropped the controller one single time. It was about a foot and a half onto carpet, landing on its side. It didn't even land on the face of the controller. That one single miniscule-impact fall now has both of my control sticks permanently out of alignment and a nonstop nuisance.Also, as other reviews have stated, bluetooth on these controllers is complete junk. It's annoying to set up (including needing to be wired in the first place to do that, so good luck if your controller didn't come with an adequate cable) and doesn't work properly. My controller reads every main face button (A,B,X,Y) as an input of two different buttons and no amount of configuration in the accessories app could fix it, in addition to the control stick reading a constant diagonal movement that leads to my character in smite or fighting games constantly spinning in a circle. I had to use a bluetooth adapter dongle my brother gave me to make the controller behave, and then the small drop happened and it's now useless for fighting games and a nuisance on smite anyway.This controller lasted me less than 3 months and required a purchase of additional hardware to use. DO NOT BUY IT if you're not specifically in need of one for use with the Series X. The only reason I'm not giving it a 1-star is because the controller itself feels like an improvement over the previous xbox controller due to increased weight, a better gripped back surface, and a significant improvement on the directional pad.",negative
Quality is hit or miss - buy old style controller if possible.,1.0,"The look and feel of this controller is great, but it became immediately apparent that something was wrong when fresh batteries registered as only 20% charged.Soon to follow came joystick drift, buttons not registering, and total signal loss.My ""old"" style xbox one controller works perfectly fine.

Update: Not so great: started out good.,2.0,"Update: June 5th,Very unhappy: the D Pad will not work properly and feels as if it barely moves now when attempting to press it.Started off good, but now feel very off about even buying another one to solve the issue I am having.Sad..________😁 Hello,To say the least: I completely undermined the new controllers and prematurely ordered a cover thinking that I would not like it. 🤐😶🥺However, I was wrong. ❌ Despite still using the cover: it is not because I do not like the size difference or the feel of the new one..I am now using the cover to keep the controller as new as possible because I am in LOVE with it.😍🥰❣I am a girl gamer that has big hands. Therfore, guys and girls, all I want to say is that.. you will like the small tweaks they made. It not only feels higher quality, it looks it, and does the job! 💕💟I snatched this white one for $49 and feel beyond happy about it! I am grateful for the sale and only received this item about 2 hours ago now.I updated it and played a little: it works wonders! I suggest it to anyone and everyone that is in need of a new controller. The old ones break easy..It is worth the upgrade!

Purchased for PC controller games,5.0,"Honestly, I bought this controller for my PC. Xbox controllers are more compatible for PC's vs Sony, due to some trivial stuff that Sony pulls. Bluetooth compatible if your motherboard/PC has the ability. If the PC doesn't, buy an adaptor and you'll be able to sync it up easily enough.Price wise, this is a good buy. But this depends if you are buying for the color, the controller, or the price. Personally, I was buying this for the price and the necessity of the controller; not the color, but it's a very bright color. The back part is white, but barely visible. More than likely, you'll never even see it or pay attention; if this is a deal breaker for you; than don't buy.",positive
An Improvement,5.0,"Overall, cool controller. I bought this purely for the aesthetics and it’s pretty sweet. The blue color is vivid, the textured grip is nice, the updated d-pad is sweet, and the bumpers are nice and clicky - an improvement from the standard Xbox one controllers. The controller is slightly smaller than the previous standard controller and can take a little getting used to. My hands were uncomfortable the first few uses but now I’ve adapted. Might even get the red one.",positive
"Solid controller, definitely like rubberized stick (heads), textured grips & triggers",4.0,"Like:Timely delivery. Controller feels solid and I definitely like the rubberized stick (heads), textured grips and triggers.  Simple, fast pairing (with Xbx console) followed by a controller update.No issues with initial use and game play. This is a mechanically sound controller. Dedicated capture button is handy (vs old cumbersome SOP). Good price @ $50 (pre-tax) for this white controller (other colors available, but significantly more expensive).Dislike:Upper controller shell edge/seam noticeably ""rough"" (vs all of my other controllers); feels unfinished when touching/picking up controller in contact with upper edge (sharp plastic) . For actual game play/use - i.e., thumbs on sticks, index fingers on bumpers or triggers - not an issue; but do notice when shifting grip, etc., and contacting seam. Curious if this issue perhaps limited to initial production only or off-spec fit/finish (not caught by QA/QC), or ""expected/typical"".Also, per photos, the controller arrived in soft mailer, opened same (mailer) and immediately noticed OEM box had already been partially ripped open.Again,, hardware (controller) is functional and no apparent damage (see above) but clearly box received very rough handling &/or was deliberately opened (maybe for the 14 day Ultimate Game Pass code?) If anyone else receives controller with similar problem (ripped OEM box), pls post pics & comments.",positive
Not so sure I love this thing.,1.0,"The right trigger actually kind of sticks when you push it all the way down and make some funny springy grindy type sounds,. but when you let go of it it kind of feels like it's hanging up on something and you can feel it kind of like catching on something plus when you get it all the way down you hear a little bit of like a grinding or a crunchy sound I don't know how to explain it but it seems the work fine besides thatThe sticks do it seem to have some dead spots if you move the stick just a teeny tiny bit and nothing happens move it just a little bit more and you kind of get a big reaction so I don't like the dead spots in the sticks at all.  Makes it very hard to aim on a shooter type of games,.  and the triggers you got to push them almost all the way down before they really start to register on the race car games so when you're giving it gas it's pretty much no gas or everything and then sometimes the car will do wheel spins because you're just stomping on the gas so quick so I'm not really loving this controller honestly.Got it for my Windows 10 PC and hooked up the Bluetooth and that works great,. I tried calibrating it on the PC and everything else and nothing's really changed.  So it's got some problems plus the controls have some dead spots instead of start reacting instantly like they should",negative

My favorite new controller,5.0,"This controller took me by surprise because I didn’t think it would feel that much different from the Xbox one controller but really the slight change of size really makes it much more comfortable in my hands. Controller is perfect in terms of its size, I feel the dual sense controller is too large And them making the bumpers on the dual sense larger makes it harder to switch between them and the triggers. But anyways the Xbox controller is much better I feel this generation, smart changes to the overall size and adding the share button in the middle make it a simple upgrade but a worthwhile one. Got rid of all my Xbox one controllers and got these to replace them, awesome work Microsoft.",positive

Good controller but only okay connectivity,1.0,"Update 01/05/21:Dropping this review down to one star. Still disconnects even two feet from the USB Bluetooth Device. I've updated the Bluetooth driver, Windows 10, and Controller firmware. None of it appears to work.I bought this Controller to play games on the PC. Connecting the controller initially wirelessly was a breeze but it kept disconnecting. So I disabled my onboard Bluetooth and switched to a Pluggable closer to where I was sitting. That worked better but it still sporadically disconnects.Pros: It works well with the PC. Games picks it up a lot easier than other Controller's. It uses standard AA batteries which I personally really like because it means I don't have to keep it charged at all times. Rechargeable AA batteries are cheap and plentiful plus batteries eventually die so it means longer life.Cons: Compared to the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller the plastic feels cheaper. Both Controller's use hard plastic but the Xbox controller definitely feels cheaper. As I mentioned above, Bluetooth connection seems weak.",negative
Do Not Buy = Not Xbox One Console Controller,1.0,"I am giving this item only one star because it turned out not to be a controller that would work on an Xbox One Console. The whole time that I was purchasing I thought it was made to work on the Xbox One console along with working on a mobile phone or PC. On the back of the box down in the left corner in tiny print it said ""not for Xbox One console"". It really ticked me off. Luckily by grandson wanted it to use on his phone so his mother purchase item from me. Now I am still looking for an Xbox One Console Controller and I should have made my purchase direct from Microsoft like everyone had told me to do. They said that way I would get what I wanted and it would for sure be brand new and correct item.",negative
Worthless on Bluetooth in Windows 10,1.0,"This ""latest version"" controller is erratic and unusable in Windows 10. Updated via USB-C, re-paired it, and tried to play FIFA 21 through Origin on a gaming pc, and, well, I can't use it. Buttons sort of work at first, but as soon as I push a direction on the d-pad or left stick, just keeps moves erratically all over in all directions for a bit until it stays pushing down constantly. Controller testing shows zero drift though, so it could be EA garbage. Paired with a laptop - exact same behavior. Probably a driver, hardware, OS and/or software issue. If only it was made by the same company that makes the.....oh.",negative
"Does indeed work with Xbox One chatpad, but I needed to exchange the first one",4.0,"MOST RECENT UPDATE:Xbox support finally got back to me on Twitter, but only after I sent them  message saying how disappointed I was in them. They insisted that the controller should work with my chatpad, so I did an exchange. Lo and behold, they were right. I simply got a bad one on the first try.The controller itself does seem to be an improvement over the Xbox One versions. It has better texture on the grips and the triggers and bumpers seem to be better made. The buttons seem the same, which is disappointing but at least they're not worse. The share button is not needed if you have a chatpad, but I'm sure it's nice for those who don't.As for Microsoft and Xbox support, we'll I don't have much good to say. They didn't respond until I stayed after them, and even then the response was anything but apologetic. They really don't seem to care. It's really disappointing because Xbox on the whole is a solid platform; in many ways it's better than its competitors. Too bad their support is worse now than it ever was.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Before I bought this controller, I asked Microsoft if an Xbox One chatpad would work with it. They answered that yes, it would. Well, it doesn't. I have two other Xbox One controllers and the chatpad works fine in both, so it's not the chatpad. It clicks into this new controller, but there is no power. It does not work. This was a deciding factor in my purchase, and since it fails to live up to what was promised it only gets one star.This review could be updated if there is a response from Microsoft.UPDATE:I have received no response from Microsoft, not here nor anywhere else I've tried. They do not seem to care about this. I'll be returning this controller as soon as the July 4 holiday is over.Thanks for nothing, Microsoft/Xbox. For the record, your controllers and the lack of support for them continues to be one of the worst parts of the Xbox experience.",positive
"Same X|S Controller, Bold Color",5.0,"The pulse red controller is the same generation 9 controller that comes with the Xbox Series S|X but with a bold red and white color scheme. The buttons, D-pad  are black, along with a band of black covering the top portion of the controller and including the shoulder and trigger buttons. There are tiny colored dots in the center of the B, A, X, Y buttons that correspond to the letter colors since the buttons themselves are all black. The D-pad is snappy and features the new ""+"" shape/disc shape combo that feels like its a hybrid of the D-pad from the Xbox One base controller and the Elite controller.Things to know If you haven't ever had a gen 9 controller:- It works with Xbox One consoles as well and can also be paired to PC, iPhone, Android while still being paired to a conole- The underside of the controller and the triggers have a new grippy surface that makes it less slippery.- Theres now a share button under the home button. A quick press takes a screenshot and a long press records a video clip- The USB charging port/Connection port is now USB-C. If you use the lipo battery pack, instead of AA batteries, you should invest in a long USB-C cord",positive
The best pc controller,5.0,"As a picky pc gamer I absolutely recommend this controller for anyone considering getting one for general gaming, first person shooters (yes, I know theres a keyboard and mouse) and 2d platforming. I'm no pro fighting game guy so can't say if i'd recommend for that but I don't see why it wouldn't be a good optionI see the battery compartment as a big plus as this prevents long term head aches changing a li ion battery, if you are into recharging that way you can get the replaceable li ion battery plus 9 foot cable and you are set.Bluetooth connectivity and wired are super easy to set up and have great latency either way. The only downside is if you want to use wired headphones through your controller you have to use the windows wireless adapterThe texturized grip feels great and really does help with sweaty hands for example in intense multiplayer action or when trying to beat a particullarly tough foe in sekiro for example.Feel in hand is premium, there is no plastic play and squeaky sounds if you grip it hard like in previous models, it feels solid.The dpad, front facing buttons and shoulder buttons are very tactile and give an audible feedback, wether or not you are into that is personal prefierence, for me its quite satisfying. I've heard of cases where the Y button is not very responsive but so far I have no such issues and thoroughly tested itOverall an excellent, stylish, comfortable, versatile controller. Very easy to set up and with great compatibility around the board. That's why I give it a 5 out of 5",positive
Cheap Feeling and Overpriced,3.0,"Maybe my expectations are high because I've been using my Elite 2 controller a lot lately, but even this controller feels cheap and plasticky compared to my two white Xbox one S controllers and my black Xbox one X controller. It feels a lot more like the cheap original Xbox one controller. However, it makes up for this with a slightly better D-pad, share button, textured grip and triggers, and suppposedly lower latency. However, I personally don't think this is worth the extra money unless you absolutely need an extra controller, which I don't. I'm contemplating on returning it.",neutral
1st impressions after 4 hours of use UPDATE,2.0,So far it's a decent controller however the slots for the battery cover are different than the Xbox One controllers so I don't have a useable battery cover for my Nyko rechargeable battery packs(image 2) and the lack of back buttons to replace the bumpers like the PowerA Enhanced controller(image 3) make it a bit unnatural and awkward to useUpdate: on October 1st the left stick suddenly developed severe stick drift about two or three weeks short of me having it for a year so I bumped my previous 3-star to a two-star,negative
Wait for Microsoft to update the drivers!,1.0,"If you need a controller for PC and prefer the Xbox controllers, get an Xbox One controller, for the time being.Microsoft needs to fix the issues with the Series X/S controllers before they properly function.  When using a Bluetooth connection to my computer, the Series X/S controller will have either randomized controls, sometimes pull in a random direction with neither of the thumbsticks being touched, or have massive input lag as long as about a quarter of a second before whatever game I'm playing is able to register the input as having started or stopped.  When connected via a USB C cable, those issues stop, but the controller then sees repeated disconnects and reconnects every few seconds, making it unusable.These issues are widespread enough that you can easily find information, as well as a long-running thread on Microsoft's forums, about the issue and people who have a problem with it.  Below is a list of workarounds that can be attempted, but aren't guaranteed to work.NONE OF THESE ARE GUARANTEED TO WORK.  It's hit or miss and may sometimes even fail to work after initially working, if you're lucky enough for one or multiple of them to work at all.  For me, nothing I tried worked, but there's no reports of an Xbox One controller having issues, nor has my Xbox One controller given me any issues.  Again, any combination could possibly work, but could also completely fail to work, as this problem is something Microsoft needs to fix, but have now had months to do so and haven't fixed anything:1) Connect the Series X/S controller to your computer via a USB C cable, then update its firmware with the Xbox Accessories app from the Windows store2) Download and install the 20H2 Windows update3) Don't use Bluetooth, just play with a wired connection via a USB C cable4) Disable 2.4GHz Wifi on your gateway or router (no, I'm not kidding, this fixed Bluetooth for some people, but did absolutely nothing for others - some also used this to make the wireless adapter for the controller, the one you have to separately purchase from Microsoft, work)5) Disable 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wifi on your gateway or router (see 4 for comments)6) Purchase the wireless adapter for the controller from Microsoft, then connect with that, not Bluetooth or a wired connection (I highly suggest AGAINST this, as it then rewards Microsoft for their failures, and it's yet another thing that hasn't helped some people)7) Mix and match any combination of the previously mentioned workarounds8) JUST BUY A DIFFERENT CONTROLLER THAT ISN'T A SERIES X/S CONTROLLERRemember, if a fix works for you, it's not indicative of a solution for everyone, it simply means it happens to have worked specifically for you.I'm not certain whether or not the Xbox One controllers are still being manufactured, but if they aren't being manufactured, then purchasing one won't see Microsoft obtaining any money from your purchase if it's through a 3rd-party seller, such as someone here on Amazon.  However, if the Xbox One controllers are still being manufactured, then you'll at least have a useable controller when/if Microsoft ever fixes the issues with the Series X/S controllers, instead of having wasted money on a useless wireless adapter that serves no purpose but to reward Microsoft for their failures.If you're using this controller for a Series X/S console, I'm sorry to have to also tell you that a large number of people are having just as many issues on those consoles as they are on PC.IF Microsoft ever fixes the issues, then the controller is actually superior to the Xbox One controller, even with its weirdly shaped D-pad.  The D-pad is actually more clicky, making it have a better tactile response, and the bumpers are similarly clicky and have a better tactile response, as well as a texture to them, rather than smooth plastic.  The controller itself is also more textured, thus allowing for a better and more comfortable grip than the Xbox One controller.  The overall shape is effectively identical to the Xbox One controller.  However, since the controller is currently an expensive paperweight, it's absolutely useless, thus making it currently worse than any controller.UPDATE:After a bit more testing and gathering more evidence as to the problem, it would appear the controller is suffering from poorly programmed drivers or other accompanying software.  Unfortunately, the Xbox One controller I previously said to purchase as an alternative isn't actually an option for some games, as it, too, seems to have some issues.  There's also been some people who said their Xbox One controller began to get buggy after an update that was released around the same time the Series X/S consoles and controller was released.  Of the 3 Microsoft controllers I have, being a wired Xbox 360 controller, Xbox One controller, and a Series X/S controller, the only one that isn't displaying any problems on any game is my Xbox 360 controller.  Although, the issues with the Xbox One controller are drastically fewer than the Series X/S controller, with the only issues with it I've so far seen being some odd issue with framerate and frame latency in some games, or very minor input lag of just a few frames on another.  That vs the unusable state of the Series X/S controller does indeed make it a step forward, but still problematic.If this issue is ever fixed, I'll give one final update to this review, but it seems it'll be an ongoing issue that Microsoft will simply refuse to admit exists.  I am, however, gathering large amounts of user experiences and notes on my own experiences, so I can have the evidence needed to prove to them that there's a problem, for whatever little good it may do, if anything at all.",negative
Absolutely Disappointing,1.0,"I was excited to receive this controller as I've had no problem with Xbox controllers in the past: durable, comfortable and stylish. This rendition? A short-term disappoinment. With light-use in PC gaming, there is left thumbstick drift that is utterly unbearable; it's the type of ""crap that will get you killed in a game"" bad.While I'm at it, the D-pad is SO DAMN LOUD! How did this make it out of Microsoft's ""prestigious"" quality assurance? I was denied a replacement because my warranty expired (no sure how long controller warranty lasts) even though it's been less than 5 months. My Xbox One controller has lasted for over 4 years! Avoid this controller for now until design improvements or new variants come out. The noise from the D-pad alone will drive you insane if you have ears. If you're a PC gamer, I recommend either an Xbox One S controller or a Dualsense which has the lowest latency of all controllers at the time of this review.",negative
Garbage with drift out the box,1.0,"Just got the controller yesterday evening, just connected it and updated it. Started to play rocket league right now and the drift on it makes the game unplayable. Whole reason I bought the controller was to replace a 20dollar controller that had gotten drift. Decided not to be cheap but I have the same problem and it's ""BRAND NEW"". Package look sus, probably a refunded one that got sent to me. Never had this happened and I'm pissed, sending this trash back. I bought a red one too comes in a couple days, hopefully it's isn't more of the same.",negative
Won't stay connected,1.0,"I paid for an official Microsoft device because I thought it would avoid flakiness.Unfortunately, this has not turned out to be true. I've tried the controller on Bluetooth, on multiple computers. I've tried it with a new Microsoft XBox wireless dongle, again on multiple computers. In all cases I've been sitting within a few feet of the computer, so distance should not be a problem.But, on bluetooth or Xbox dongle, I've found the same thing. The controller connection has drop-outs - as evidenced by the controller indicator going into ""flashing"" mode for 20 seconds or so. This consistently happens every few minutes, which makes it painful to keep playing with it.There seems to be no reasonable cause for  this. I use other bluetooth devices (e.g.: headsets) on the same computers at the same time, and do not experience drop-outs with them.",negative
Great controller. Very happy.,5.0,"Great controller. I like it a touch more then the xbox one s controller. Both are excellent but I like the digital pad personally on the new series controller.Also has a bit more texture on it. So it's not as smooth. This didn't really matter much to me, but wanted to let others know.Obviously usb c is a nice addition. A much better port that doesn't wear out like micro sd.They added a 3rd button for share which I haven't used yet. Might be nice if it can be mapped on emulators for exit button/hotkey button. Someday I'll give it a try and report.Built in bluetooth very nice with minimal lag feel. Worked on android devices, pc, and of course xbox.If I were looking for a new controller, I would chose this over the old Xbox Series X. While they could have attempted something completely new, this was safer and was a nice upgrade to a already great controller.",positive
Worthy upgrade IMO,5.0,"This still requires AA batteries, and I like that! I'd rather swap out my Eneloop rechargeable batteries than have to be wired to my console. Rechargeable batteries last several years before needing to replace them, so thank you keeping it this way among all the noise about still using them.The bumpy handles and triggers is prolly my favorite upgrade though. I have a condition that makes my hands sweat all the time, and the bumpy handles and triggers keep my hands from slipping all over the place like it did on the previous controller.The share button is also a nice addition, since I take a lot of screenshots and record gameplay. All in all this controller is awesome.SLIGHT complaint though. I don't like the ""loud"" clicking sound of the dpad. Not a dealbreaker but I wish it was quieter.",positive
Another slight improvement on the MS controller,5.0,"So going from the 360 to xbone to the current Xbox wireless controller for the X/S/PC had been a marginal improvement.  It's a little up to you on if it's worth it if you have an old controller and it's still working.I'm using this with a PC and the Xbox wireless adapter, I haven't tested with BT. (on my previous Xbone controller, I tried BT first and had intermittent button issues, so I got the adapter and the issues went away).  The main 2 things I notice is the D-pad is a little better, albeit also clickier.  And also the bottom grips are more texturized, which makes the controller less likely to pop out of your hand.  I never had that problem with the previous one, but I could do it if I tried.  On this controller, there's enough friction that I can't squeeze the controller up and out.  So that's good.  I'm also really happy to have a non-white/black controller for once, just for a little color's sake.About the biggest negative I have at this point is I wish they could have redesigned the battery door at this point.  This one seemed like a big pain in the arse to get the door off to put in batteries.  I'm hopeful it loosens up.If you're using with a PC, I recommend downloading the Xbox Accessories app.  For starters you can test your buttons in it to make sure they respond, but also as soon as I launched it when I first turned on the controller, it had a firmware update for the controller.  I'd recommend doing that only with the xbox wireless adapter or even better with a usb-c cable plugged in if you have one, just to make sure it doesn't brick.",positive
Unfortunately out of return window,3.0,"- Doesn't work with older bluetooth radio (~2.1?)- Works worse than used previous gen.- Microsoft support shouldn't exist.When I initially bought this controller, it would not connect to my computer using the old bluetooth radio. It connects fine to my other devices with newer radios. After struggling to get answers from Microsoft support (and generally failing, as they rely on the community and I wouldn't recommend it) I finally wound up calling my friend over with his previous gen controllers (the ones immediately before this one) and a bluetooth dongle.I later wound up discovering that this controller uses Bluetooth 5.0 (or at least 'is compatible with'). Still don't know the minimum BT version required to use it, but it's > the 2.1 dongle radios I had.Worse, though, the piece of junk keeps losing signal mid-game. I've been able to play entire 30+ minute rounds without it happening, and I've also had it happen multiple times in a 10-minute window. Maybe it's one of those Apple ""Don't hold it with your left hand"" type situations. I wouldn't know. Microsoft would need actual support to tell me if there were any kind of issue.I recently 'broke down' and bought a used controller from the previous gen: the gray and green. It's incredibly aesthetically pleasing to me, though it is objectively a worse controller (grips, D-pad). But it don't friggin lose signal. At all.Using this controller is as frustrating as playing dark souls with a working controller. And it's why I'll forever mock any idiot shelling out $200 for an elite controller. Microsoft can design controllers real well. But they can't manufacture them for sh",neutral
Amazing controller!,5.0,"First off I’d like to say I own a Nintendo Switch, PS4 Pro, PS5, Arcade Stick, and a very high end gaming PC. I have basically every controller out. Switch Pro, PS4, Xbox One, PS5, generic ones, Scuff pads, etc.This new Xbox pad imo is the best controller on the market not counting the Elite which costs over 2x as much. The colors look absolutely amazing. It’s almost identical to the original Xbox One pad except it has a normal headphone port, it comes with textured grips and triggers, as well as a new share button. While I enjoy the Sony pads they will never be as good as Xbox pads due to the joystick placement. Your hands rest naturally much better on joysticks that are offset versus parallel. The new textured grips and triggers just improved on what was already the best controller and the new color options really look nice. I also enjoy the Switch Pro pad but the Xbox one is jus that little bit nicer. I don’t have an Xbox I use the controller on my gaming PC which can use any controller I want. As I said many other controllers to use on my PC and this one imo is the best. I included pics of the pad as well as other controllers for comparing. TLDR - Best controller on the market outside of Pro/Elite options. I do have Kontrol Freek performance thumb stick grips in all my pads but that’s personal preference. I got blue ones for this controller to match the rest of it and imo it looks really nice.",positive
"Good for Windows, Low Quality Construction Warrants Choosing SONY PS5 as Console",3.0,"I am a PC gamer and purchased this controller to play Genshin Impact. This is primarily due to poor support for the Switch Pro and DualSense 5 controllers. That being said, this controller does what it needs to do without the need for 3rd party mapping software, and the rumble feature works fine.That's basically it for all the positive aspects for this controller.Now for the cons: the buttons on this thing are uncomfortable and feels cheap. Compared to SONY and Nintendo controllers, the travel distance for all the buttons (A,B,X,Y + D-Pad) are too far and feels cheap and plasticky. Each button press generates an annoying and hollow plastic click. My thumb gets tired a lot quicker pressing the aforementioned buttons. If you own a SONY or Nintendo controller, do a side by side comparison and you'll see what I mean.TL;DR - great software support, HORRENDOUS build quality.",neutral
"Constantly disconnnects, sticky trigger, sharp edges.",1.0,"This controller is garbage, plain and simple. Constantly disconnecting whether I'm using bluetooth, or the Micorsoft wireless adapter I spent extra money on to try and solve the disconnect problem. My tower is two feet away, so its not a distance problem. My decade old Xbox 360 controller is better than this, even though its totally worn out. sometimes when it disconnects, you can't even turn it off. you have to remove the batteries to get it going again. Its also too small in my hands, and the sharp edge on the inside of the handle gave me a blister on my pinky. Oh, and did I mention every time I press the right trigger it sticks down for a second before popping back up? I despise this controller.",negative
"Standard, reliable xbox controller.. nothing more nothing less",4.0,"Box came damaged from amazon.com llc but controller is fine.  Controller was very dusty for some reason.. almost as if it was used, but nothing else seemed used.  It was otherwise, clean and didn't smell, no scuffs, etc.  So I'm just going to keep it since it seems to work fine on my initial use.  I like the D-pad much more than the last gen.. it's much more clicky.The fact that this can use AA batteries is a HUGE plus.  Many people find this as a con.. but that makes 0 sense since they go ahead and buy ""battery packs"" that are marked up but are the same thing as rechargeable batteries?? LOL.. the logic of some people is just mind blowingly stupid. Eneloops.I used this for the PC and ipad and have no issues with the games I play.It does feel a bit slimmer than the last gen of controllers.. if you're not very observant.. this won't affect you, but it's definitely not exactly the same.  It's not a bad thing, just something to know.  And if you're coming from an old controller.. this new one might feel weird.. but that's just because it's... ""new"" and needs to be broken in.  I definitely feel more fluid on my old controller, but it's years old and broken in.Would definitely recommend for ppl who like this layout.  This is the only layout I prefer.",positive
A solid controller with one odd behavior,4.0,"I purchased this to replace a generic wired X-Box compatible controller for PC gaming. That controller did not have a precise enough feeling to the right stick, and I found the D-pad difficult to use. This X-Box controller does not suffer from those problems, and I found the sticks to be precise enough to use for non-competitive first person shooter games. I find the buttons responsive, and the triggers to be smooth and quiet. I am a male adult with large hands, and find the controller to be comfortable to use for several hours at time.I found the Blue Tooth  pairing process to be simple enough, and the connection has been solid. I have played about 10-12 hours so far and have not experienced a single disconnect and have not been able to detect any lag between input and response on screen. I am using this with a TP-Link Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter (purchased on Amazon) with a Windows 10 PC.I did experience one minor problem that I find irritating, but probably does not affect 99% of users. When I first connected the controller I used a USB C-to-A data cable, and the PC detected the controller and it worked well. I then paired the controller via Blue Tooth, which also worked well. I then downloaded the Microsoft App that allows you to test and customize the controller (button mappings, stick sensitivity, etc). It detected the controller and allowed me to test it, but instructed me to connect the controller using a cable for customization as BT is not supported. I have been unable to get this Windows PC, or any other, to see this controller over the wired connection (not just this app but via Device Manager / Control Panel). I have tried double clicking the connect button to toggle between BT mode and X-box 2.4 mode, removing the battery, etc, but this has no effect as the controller is never detected when using a cable (it just turns on, rumbles, and blinks, but never shows up). I have scoured the internet for directions on how to re-enable wired mode, but have not found anything useful.",positive
Good,5.0,"Purchased to replace a faulty Xbox One gamepad I used with my PC. I was able to re-use the Microsoft-brand rechargeable battery pack and wireless adapter used with the Xbox One gamepad, so save yourself $10+ buying the bare controller if you already have those items. This uses a USB-C cable for charging instead of the mini-USB cable.Item came in original box, looks and feels new, functions smoothly, and receives firmware updates, so it appears legit.",positive
"Great controller, with some bugs to work out",4.0,"I bought this for PC gaming, due to it having native Bluetooth support.It feels a lot like the previous Xbox controller, with some differences. The D-pad feels more clicky and tactile, and the shoulders/bumpers have a dotted texture. The shoulders, bumpers, and D-pad are no longer glossy but are matte, which I appreciate. Everything else feels the same as the previous one. Possibly the perfect controller.The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because the Bluetooth compatibility is still kinda wonky. At the time of writing this review, this controller does not work with the Steam Link device over Bluetooth, only through wired USB connection. It also has some issues when connecting to a Windows PC over Bluetooth. It'll work with some games, and not with others. It works fine with a wired connection though.",positive
Randomly Disconnects In Game,1.0,"This controller looks and feels like a slight upgrade from the Xbox One controlller, but unfortunately it is not. Unlike the previous Xbox One controller, this just doesn't quite work right with Windows. It will pair with Bluetooth just fine, will be detected by the official Xbox One controller app, and be detected by games. However, as you start to play, it will just randomly stop working.This usually starts as a weird lag, like you turn your character in-game but it feels like you're moving through molasses. This will be momentary, but within the next couple minutes the controller will just disconnect itself. This will usually cause the game to go haywire and will take your last detected input and run with it. Great way to run off a cliff in Dark Souls! Sometimes it will reconnect immediately and be fine, othertimes I need to spend a good amount of time unpairing/re-pairing it.This controller just isn't reliable enough to be used even by a casual gamer like myself. Also, the DPad and face buttons are very loud. My cat will not stay in the same room as me if I'm playing a 2D game that needs a lot of DPad input.It feels sturdier than the original Xbox One controller, but I can't be sure because I haven't been able to use this much since it's basically defective. Go for the original Xbox One controller; they are basically the same thing except they work far more reliably. Just be aware those controllers have their issues too, like soft plastic thumbsticks that become easily grooved around their base through light use, leading to a nails-on-the-chalkboard feeling whenever you angle it far enough (e.g. running in a game).",negative
Incompatible with PC,1.0,"Bought this for my PC.  It connected easily enough, but that's the only good thing I can say about it.Using the left stick to navigate a menu, it was always two clicks at a time, no matter how little the stick was moved.  If I needed to move one item on the menu, I was completely out of luck.  There was literally no way to do it.I also experienced terrible stick drift.  Serious, unplayable amounts of it.  To even quit a game that had an ""Are you sure you want to quit?"" I would have to time my button press just right to leave the game, because the stick drift would cause me to scroll through the options (No, Save and Quit, Yes) repeatedly, at high speed.  It was like playing a game of roulette where the prize was successfully quitting the game that I wanted to play.But here's the weird thing...  All of this was only a problem when connected via bluetooth.  If I connected to the computer via a USB cable, the controller worked fine.  But I didn't shell out $60 for a wireless controller that didn't work wirelessly, so this product is getting returned.Also, I tried the controller on both my desktop and my laptop, so I'm sure it wasn't my computer that was the problem.  Additionally, I also tried replacing the controller before asking for a refund (thinking that maybe the first one was just defective), and the replacement controller had the exact same problems. I'm confident that it wasn't just a case of one bad controller.I thought I would be getting an upgrade from the generic off-brand controller I had bought half a decade ago.  Needless to say this was a huge disappointment.",negative
Great Controller for PC,5.0,"This controller is perfect if you need one for a PC.It connects via Bluetooth but you also have the option to connect it via USB C which is really the biggest improvement over the prior Xbox One controller (which connected using micro USB).It’s very similar to the prior Xbox controllers, which isn’t a bad thing as I’ve always preferred the Xbox controller layout over other controllers. The D Pad and bumper buttons feel a lot more stiff and responsive than the prior Xbox One controller and I really like the new design of the D Pad with its angular shape. Also as when using prior Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers with PCs, it works seamlessly with Windows and the drivers are installed automatically as soon as you connect.Overall this is a solid controller! 5/5!",positive
Very high quality! Better than my PS4 controller!,5.0,"This is a very sturdy, well made controller! It has a nice weight and doesn't feel cheap at all, it also stays connected to my PC all the time, unlike my previous Xbox controller which cost over 100 dollars. It is a great controller at a great price and I would highly recommend getting this if you are on the fence. I'm coming from using PS4 controllers which I thought were higher quality until I got this one for use on my PC and can happily say that the build quality of this is just as good if not better than my PS4 controllers. The camo design looks great and the plastic is not cheap, I will definitely be buying another controller for my son. Just buy one and see, you won't regret it!",positive
The Best in Controllers,5.0,"I've been using official Microsoft Xbox controllers since the X360 came out.  This newest version (1914) feels well built.  They've upgraded the connector/charging port to USB-C!  The controller back plate and triggers have textured plastic that helps keep it steady in your hands.  The new ""D"" pad style is also smooth and comfortable to use.  I'm using mine as a Bluetooth-connected PC controller on Windows 10.The only problem I've run into is the Bluetooth connection to my PC was dropping periodically.  I have the Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX200 card in the PC.  Upgrading the controller firmware helped a lot, but it is still happening periodically.  I also turned of the Bluetooth power management in the PC Device Manager.I have a ticket into Microsoft Support to work on this issue, but overall this controller is perfect.",positive
Does Not Work,1.0,I bought this to use with my pc and it doesn't work. The first issue is the bluetooth it randomly disconnects in the middle of the game. I attempted to connect via USB and the inputs will stop working at random times which creates problems. I updated the firmware using the xbox accessories app this did not fix it.,negative
"Feels nice like the old one, but a little rough for soft hands.",3.0,"It feels not much different from the xbox one s controllers except the bit of texture on the triggers, shoulder buttons, and a rough hatchmark sorta texture underneath the main body's grip.Mine came with the left bumper buttin feeling squishy, not as clicky as the right bumper, but so far performs normally.While I appreciate the added grip, for people with really soft hands, the texture underneath where your fingertips usually digs in might feel a bit too rough after a while. Almost like sandpaper as it digs in over time with intense gaming sessions.I only keep it because I got it on sale and it's not majorly malfunctioning to need a return. So far it's okay, and feels nice like the old ones. Just wish the grippy texture was more of a silicone material than an etching into hard plastic.",neutral
Best wireless controller for PC gaming,5.0,"Disclaimer: I'm not a console gamer - I'm a PC gamer. But after fiddling with countless wired 3rd party controllers, issues with connecting my Switch Pro controller and more, I decided to just bite the bullet thanks to a recommendation from my friend and buy an Xbox controller. Here's my review after a few months with it:- Build Quality: it feels strong and sturdy in the hands with a decent weight. The buttons and triggers are tactile and responsive. I love the aesthetics of the white controller, personally.- Seamless functionality for all PC games that include controller support- Bluetooth Connectivity: I was worried that I would need to buy another adapter for PC, but when I powered it on, my PC found it immediately.** Important: UPDATE THE FIRMWARE!There was an issue when I first got it and tried to play some games where the controller would randomly disconnect; nothing in the short manual included with the controller packaging provided any hints as to what was going on. I found out that the controller needed a firmware update.In order to do this, you have to download the Xbox Accessories app for your PC, then connect your controller via a USB cable (not included but I had many lying around). You can then update the firmware from the Xbox Accessories app. Since doing this, I've had no problems at all with connectivity!Overall, it's 5 stars for me; love gaming without any wires or messing with the Bluetooth on other controllers.",positive
"Going, Going, Gone!",1.0,"I loved my new controller for the first couple of weeks!  Then, a message would quickly flash on the screen stating ""Please reconnect your controller"" and then would disappear as quickly as it appeared.  I would not miss a beat in my games and the controller was never actually ""offline.""  I could count on that message to appear three or four times in a half hour period.  Soon it began to happen more and more often (several times a minute) and, once again, I replaced the batteries and kept trying.  That seemed to work for about 10 minutes.  I ensured the device was paired properly with my console.  That did not help.  Today and with a brand new set of batteries, it quit entirely.  It shows that it is ""powered,"" but will not react to any button pressing, etc.  What a downer that the return window closed a little over a week ago.  Sigh.",negative
Amazing Controller in a Spectacular Colorway,5.0,"In my opinion, this is the best color Microsoft has released in the Xbox Series X/S controller lineup as of today. Although it's a bit pricey, it's definitely worth getting. It's exactly what you'd expect from Microsoft's newest generation of Xbox controllers (i.e. grippier triggers, improved functionality), but it's draped in this neon green/highlighter type color. The color stands out so well and I love how vibrant it looks, especially in natural daylight. Also, switching between Series X and Windows 10 is a breeze. I'm definitely going to put this controller to good use.",positive
Doesnt work as described,1.0,Warning! Not truly compatible with xbox one. Fails to hold a connection. I've tried 2 of them so it's not a product defect.,negative
Robot white Xbox core controller,5.0,Love the new style controller this may not happen to others but when I first got it the right top bumper did stick in but the more I used the bumper the less it started sticking other than that I absolutely love this new style controller yes it does feel different compared to the launch / Xbox one s controller but you’ll get used to it fast the box did come damaged sadly but I fixed it some what as you can see from the pics I’m using this with my Xbox one s it was either this or a plain Xbox one white controller so I chose the new one my old controller wouldn’t charge anymore as the port got damaged but other than that I love this controller but if it does break there is a Microsoft warranty so thanks to the seller and Amazon y’all rock 🖤 btw I did buy the new charge kit with the controller but I can confirm the old battery does indeed fit and work with the new controller all you would need for this one is a usb c cable,positive
Terrible stick drift after light use for 6 months,1.0,"I thought I was having other problems from another controller input causing weird behavior but I finally realized that after having used this controller for 6 months, I've identified that there is something functionally wrong with the left stick where it will not re-center.  It physically re-centers but the input isn't recognized as being centered.  This probably started about a month or two after owning it but I didn't notice with the game that I play (Rocket League).  I just thought the car I was using had very unstable aerial rotation but it is this controller.  For the price, this thing should really last much longer than a few months!  I just hope that Microsoft's support will be helpful.",negative
"How to fix Bluetooth issues on pc, you are lucky if you see this.",5.0,"-You must get an official or a ""xones"" battery pack. I prefer the xones because it is real nice, and the included cable is braided, long, has a usb 2 mini adapter (very useful for everything), AND HAS A CHARGING INDICATOR which the controller does not, even with the official pack. Dont ask me why a Battery pack seems to be REQUIRED for it not to disconnect, but believe me it works.-You can only have the controller connected to BT and thats it. It WILL disconnect (less with the pack) but it will still disconnect if you have something like Your Phone attached to pc via Bluetooth as well.-I'm not just someone who is just posting this with his fingers crossed. I had a hellish review of this ready to go. Now months later the disconnects are gone and have not had one...unless I connect anything else to Bluetooth.-Just to be safe (this is optional, but good practice), get a usb extension cable (cheap), attach your bluetooth dongle to that, and put it out of site on your desk (so its closer to the controller).Its worth it, because its a great, very sturdy controller (moreso than xbox 360). I promise you will not have disconnects unless there is interference. I live in an apartment with rooms all around me, and these steps make this controller an excellent Xbox 360 controller replacement.",positive
Highly Disappointing and Uncomfortable,1.0,"The only good thing I can say about this controller is that the plastic shell has a decent feel to it. Using it on Windows 10 allows for simply plug-and-play so you can get straight into gaming.Shoulder bumper buttons are uncomfortable to press while holding down a corresponding trigger due to the positioning of the button. I can expect carpal tunnel syndrome from extended use from holding a trigger and pressing the shoulder bumper. Triggers themselves have more resistance than I would have liked which adds discomfort for games that require long durations of holding the trigger down. The XYBA buttons are mushy with an unnecessarily long travel distance on press which I have no idea why they were designed in that manner. The directional pad is decent and has short travel distance, which baffles me even further on the decision of the XYBA buttons being so mushy. Why is this acceptable? It makes the buttons feel cheap.The control sticks are also a bit too concave which feels weird to use. I can understand the design was to help maintain grip on full tilt, but it does not feel right with my thumbs.Extreme buyer's remorse with this controller. There are better controllers out there if you need one for PC gaming.",negative
Works with Apple TV and Apple Arcade (as of tvOS 14.6),5.0,"Apple’s instructions about which Xbox controllers are compatible with Apple TV (for playing games on Apple Arcade) aren’t especially clear, but I can confirm that this controller does work—for reference, my Apple TV is running tvOS 14.6 currently, so do make sure your software is up to date if you’re experiencing any issues with pairing.(Since I’m writing this review as of tvOS 14.6 it’s possible the below instructions will not be perfectly accurate for future tvOS versions)To update your Apple TV software, go to “Settings” (grey menu icon with a gear) then “System” then select “Software Updates”.To pair your controller, go to “Settings” (grey menu icon with a gear) then “Remotes and Devices” then select “Bluetooth” under Other Devices. You’ll need to power on your controller and then hold down the pairing button for a few seconds (top of the controller, next to the USB port) and then you should be able to select it from the list of available devices.You may also have to update the controller’s firmware (my Apple TV prompted me to do this after the controller seemed to have some issues maintaining a good wireless connection). You can either do this using an Xbox, or by downloading the “Xbox Accessories” app from the Microsoft store on a PC running Windows 10 and connecting to the PC using a USB-C cable. Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be any way to update the controller firmware using a Mac. Just google “Xbox controller firmware” to find the most up to date guidance.As for the controller itself, I’ve played with every standard Xbox controller since The Duke back in 2001, and they just get better and better. This one is grippy and ergonomically perfect (even for big hands) and is infinitely more comfortable for me than PlayStation controllers. The new 8-way directional pad is a welcome refinement.",positive
Used and Not Compatible With All Windows 10 PCs,2.0,"I purchased the Xbox One controller because I've recently purchased a new Windows 10 PC and needed a decent controller to game with. The reviews for the Xbox One controller were decent on PC Mag so I decided to purchase it. After reading the description of the product, per my screenshot, you can see it states that this controller is compatible with Windows 10 PCs. Unfortunately, after trying to sync the controller to my PC I realized it won't connect unless you have Xbox Wireless setup on your PC or you own the wireless adapter. Which is ridiculous considering they don't state that in the description. I thought there might be some Bluetooth capabilities with this controller, but still no connection.If you're looking to purchase this controller to hook up with your Windows PC, DON'T DO IT!Another issue, looking at the packaging you can obviously tell someone tried to put a seal where the seal should be. When I opened the package, the controller was moved around and all the pages weren't together. Some were above the controller, others were under. It looks like this was used.Overall, I'm very disappointed. If it wasn't for the fact that the Xbox controllers were so ergonomic, I would have made the product rating one star.",negative
"Excellent improvement from previous gen, but...",4.0,"First, I love the feel of this controller. I preordered and am using with my 2013 Xbox One, it's definitely an improvement. I love the new D-pad and textured grip. BUT... my reasons for 4 and not 5 stars are that I had some random disconnecting issues. Even after updating the firmware, when idle, the controller would disconnect and reconnect about every 30 seconds (on the pause screen of a game). It seems to be fixed after a full cold reboot (unplug the Xbox) and boot from the new controller. Although I noticed the disconnect message once since then, it could have been a minor glitch. It just concerns me since none of my previous Xbox One controllers ever had this issue. Also, I feel they could have improved the motors or added just a bit more haptic feedback like PS5 is doing... why waste that opportunity? Anyway, if you're an Xbox player, you'll love this controller. It's the most comfortable controller I've ever used. It also has bluetooth, which older models do not have. Time will tell if the disconnects happen again.",positive
Does not work on pc with usb type c cable.,2.0,The description of this controller is miss leading. It states you can plug the controller into your pc with a usb cable and use a companion app (Xbox accessories) the be able to use it. That is misleading the controller will power on but the pc will not pick up the controller in the app or on device manager.,negative
Feels great and works great. Also looks great.,5.0,"It was long overdue to replace my old Windows Xbox controllers. This controller has a great texture to it and plays wonderfully. The ""A"" button was a bit sticky the first time using it, which had me concerned, but I think it was just a bit stiff from being fresh from the factory. By the 2nd time I used it, the A button worked perfectly. Windows 10 implementation could be better, as it always shows the controller as having low battery, but that's an issue with Microsoft/Windows 10 and not with the controller itself. Hopefully an update will fix that soon. Having to hold the Xbox button for 6 seconds to turn the controller off is a little bit bothersome, I wish they would have made it just 3 seconds, but it's a minor gripe. I guess it's still an improvement over the older Xbox controllers where the only way to turn them off was to remove the battery pack.Been really enjoying playing games on my PC with this controller, I wish I had bought one sooner.",positive
These new controllers are junk.,1.0,"First impressions were positive enough. It looked good, I liked the textured grips, the buttons were snappy and responsive, and the d-pad is much more responsive. However, when the novelty of all that wore off, I realized I either had a defective controller or they just make these so cheap now that they only last a few gaming sessions. Within a few days I noticed that certain button presses would fail to do anything. The thumbstick for my movement would fail to respond either resulting in my character running in the direction and not being able to stop, or would decide to just go in his own direction. This makes gaming extremely difficult as I play a lot of For Honor and other fast paced combat titles. I ended up going back to my old gray and light blue controller that worked still and the problems were resolved. These new controllers are junk. I will buy 3rd party controllers from now on since the price I will have paid for 2 of the new controllers is about the cost of one custom modded one.",negative
It really is THE contoller.,5.0,"I ordered this thing skeptical of the online articles I'd read suggesting this was the best controller to buy for PC gaming (behind the Elite controller), but when I finally bit the bullet and sank in $60 (and waited two days for it to actually show up, of course), I realized where those articles were coming from.This thing just FEELS good to use. It's a noted improvement on the 360 controller in just about every conceivable way, especially with the native bluetooth compatibility that controllers from the last generation were missing.Build quality is solid. It's got a good weight, and the matte black finish hides drop scuffing waaaaaay better than the semi-gloss on other controllers. The triggers give good resistance to pull, the buttons aren't too squishy or clicky, and response time is right on the money.I can strongly recommend this to anyone who's on the fence based on price. Once you take it into your hands, you'll know what it's worth.",positive
Nearly identical to the original Xbox One controller - and that's a good thing,5.0,"I'm currently using this controller with an Xbox One S (the new Series X/S controller is fully backwards compatible) and have been pleased with most of the (subtle) differences between it and the original Xbox One controller.The redesigned d-pad is a HUGE improvement. It's clickier and far more responsive - great for playing retro arcade games. In general, all the buttons feel a little crisper (including the triggers). The stick tension feels to be about the same as on the previous model.The new 'Share' button is programmable - by default, a 'press' records a screenshot and a 'hold' records a video clip. It's nice to now have capture functions a button press away (just like they've always been on PS4).The only criticism I can level at the controller is its redesigned battery cover. I use rechargeable AA batteries and have to swap them out every 10 hours or so - removing the cover on the new controller requires far more force than I'd like. Perhaps it will loosen up in time. For now, that's not a big enough issue for me to ding a star.The original Xbox One controller wasn't ""broke,"" so there was little that Microsoft had to ""fix"" with this redesign. Both ergonomically and functionally, there's little to improve. A worthy upgrade, regardless of which Xbox you currently own.",positive
Good feel and fit,5.0,"Replaced the original controller I got with my Xbox from 2 years ago.  Price was a deal on this color otherwise I would have stayed with my original white, but the blue is kinda cool.  It connected right up with no issues.  Needed some firmware update, but that was relatively small and took hardly anytime.  They joy sticks are night and tight, the new D pad is working great.  The added texture is in the right places.  I really didn't need the addition of the dedicated screen shot button, but now that I have it, I'm sure I'll use every now and then.If you find a deal on it and need to replace an older controller, I'd say go for it!",positive
Arrived with a defective directional pad,1.0,"Three of the four directions on the D-pad make a tactile clicking sound upon pressing them, but the fourth does not and requires way too much effort to get a response out of.  I can only assume its defective.EVERYTHING else was great.It seems like a great controller if you get one without issues.  The controllers joysticks are already superior to the other 2 brands I have and the directional pad has a very comfortable design, that allows you to rock your thumb  for faster response than a standard directional padSeconds into trying it I actually considered trying it with a fighting game and I haven't used a pad for that since the d-pad on the  Xbox 360 controller left my thumb sore.",negative
Have to buy!,5.0,Beautiful controller! I love the design so vibrant and the grips are top notch! Great purchase!,positive
"Worth more compared to a generic, 2 weeks free game pass is a gimmick.",4.0,"I first bought a generic controller, it wasn't worth the money, it wouldn't stay connected to the Xbox.I returned the generic controller and bought a factory Xbox 1 controller.It paired up and updated automatically without a problem, and stays connected.It was worth the extra money to buy a factory replacement.Saves a lot of hassle and frustration.Update edit: This comes with a card that gives you a code for 2 weeks free of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.Don't plan on using it, it's worthless if you have or have had an account with them.It's a gimmick, and it's costing them a star on my edited review.Let anyone that buys these expensive controllers have the 2 weeks free, don't be greedy and gimmicky.I had originally given 5 stars until I tried to use the free code.Now they are lucky to get the 4 stars I'm leaving, deserves a 1 star.",positive
Needed a good d-pad,5.0,"I have an older 8bitdo controller that decided to stop working and needed a new controller with a good d-pad for playing platformers on my Windows 10 PC. I didn't want to get another 8bitdo controller because I lost confidence in their products after mine just stopped working for no reason. I ended up going with this one because other people have mentioned the tactile feedback the d-pad has, and yes it indeed has a very tactile feeling which I really like. It feels better than my 8bitdo controller. Easy plug-and-play with Windows 10, no need to install anything. This is leagues better than the old xbox 360 controller that I have with a practically unusable mushy d-pad.",positive
Superb Wireless Controller for PC with 1 catch,4.0,I purchased this controller because I bought a gaming Laptop but wanted to be able to use a controller when i was traveling to make things a bit easier. I bought this controller for that purpose and was excited that it could be used via Bluetooth on PC. I was able to get the controller connected to my PC via bluetooth but proceeded to have issues with games recognizing it as a controller (the main one being Warzone).I have given this product 4 stars because while it does connect to PC it's use is limited without the Xbox One Wireless Adapter for PC which is another $30. Once I received the adapter and paired them together the games I was having issues with will now recognize the controller.If you intent to use this on PC i would highly suggest that you get the adapter regardless in order to prevent the same frustration as well as have improved reaction time the wireless adapter has over bluetooth.,positive
"Better than Xbox One Controller, by a very small amount.",5.0,"This controller is all-around better than the Xbox One controller, but not by much. Everything great about the previous gen controllers is all here, however, there isn't very much new. The D-Pad is changed up and there is now a grip texture on the underside and triggers to the controller, that pretty much sums up the noticeable improvements.If you already have an Xbox One controller this won't be a big enough upgrade to be worth buying for most people if you are looking for something better, the Elite controllers are your only option there.For someone in the market for a new Xbox controller, there is no reason to buy an Xbox One controller over this one unless you really prefer the old D-Pad design more.",positive
"Bluetooth sucks, but the rest of the controller is fine",3.0,"I've had a lot of trouble getting the Bluetooth on this controller to work, occasionally while playing games on my PC (Windows 10) the controller decides it just doesn't want to anymore, and disconnects. The best part about it disconnecting mid game is that it also keeps holding down whatever input you were holding before it disconnected, for example, if you were holding the A button and the controller disconnected, the A button would remain held down until you reconnected the controller.If you're going to play wired anyways, this controller is great. I have no complaints about the actual build of the controller, besides for the texture on the back, some people may not like it but for me it's great since I have sweaty hands and I appreciate the extra grip. I haven't had any problems with the buttons sticking down psychically and it's overall pretty good, especially the D pad, it is much, much better than the Xbox 360 controller that I was previously using for PC games.",neutral
Haven't had it long but works fine,4.0,"The bumpers on my xbox one controller broke and I saw how poorly designed the bumpers were so I got this controller because it seemed like the bumpers were designed differently. People complaining about how loud the controller is are crazy, it's really not very different, if at all, from the xbox one controller. The disconnecting issue IS real but a Firmware update cuts down on the problems. The problem seemingly isn't with the hardware but has to do with compatibility with certain games so I imagine they'll cut down on that problem more and more.All that aside, feels mostly like the xbox one controller besides the texture, which I'm neutral on, and the d-pad which still works the same as the xbox one controller but with the different design. Works just as well for up, down, left, right, so I can't see it being a downgrade in any way but it may be an upgrade for people with smaller hands. Inputting commands in fighting games still works just as well as well.",positive
Controller came out of the box with game breaking joystick drift,1.0,"Needed a new controller for my computer, so naturally I go for an xbox controller. My new controller that I ordered, has joystick drift right out of the box. No amount of calibration will fix it. Honestly I'm super disappointed in this new controller model. Gonna have to try and get it replaced.",negative
Nice controller!,4.0,"I bought this controller to replace my xbox 360 controller and play The Sabotuer game on my pc. The issue that I had was that whenever I played my game for example, when I would drive a car in game pressing the triggers to accelerate and brake the in game camera would start spinning in circles. I tried to find and download the xbox 360 controller drivers again but I couldn't get them to download to my computer. I figured that Microsoft no longer supported this controller, so I bought the new Xbox Core controller. To my surprise, upon starting up the game I ran into the same issue with this new controller! I think it's just a bug in the game. Eventually I was able to play it by starting the game turning on the controller and disconnecting and reconnecting the wireless dongle. This controller feels lighter in hand than the xbox 360 controller. I like the clickiness of the d-pad and bumpers, however since the bumper on the core x controller are larger than the ones on the xbox 360 controller I end up pressing it frequently by accident. I find this to be very annoying since in The Saboteur game, the right bumper throws granades and I have to run so I don't blow myself up! :) I never had this issue with the xbox 360 controller.",positive
It works,5.0,"This gets 5 stars because it functions as it should… but there are some things to note for the cheap people like me.1. It comes with a couple Duracell batteries which is nice but the device itself does not have an inner battery than can be charged via usb-c.2. When plugged in (to my pc running windows 10) it works perfectly fine but there is always a Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Error that pops up and I haven’t troubleshooted it yet because it doesn’t seem to affect the functionality of the controller.3. It does not work with my cheap wireless dongle that plugs into the pc. Given that the cheap dongle I have was an absolute nightmare to get working with 360 controllers in the first place, this didn’t surprise me but is worth noting if you don’t have Bluetooth and want to be wireless.",positive
Make sure you can find where it says USED,3.0,"I'm only giving a halfway decent review because apparently it was listed as used which the seller tells me that means that it functions and the appearance can be... gross (my words). If it wasn't dirty and brown I might have kept it but it is a birthday present.  The add says it comes with batteries and there weren't any, not that it would matter as I am returning it. I still can't seem to find where it says it is a used item.  For the price you might as well buy new and get all the components.  As far as my review, I'm in the listing, assuming it says somewhere in the details that it is used, although I can't find it, but based on that I'm assuming it might work.  Don't know, not trying it, it's not something I want to handle a lot by the appearance.  So I gave a 3 star.  If I felt like looking again for the used descriptive words and not finding them I would have given a 1.  I thought it was a brand new controller.",neutral
Is this even official or a knockoff?,1.0,Don't try to use bluetooth. It constantly disconnects and since I play co-op I end up messing up a lot. Use it wired. It's fine. The buttons feel cheap and the analogue sticks are way too sensitive making aiming annoying.I don't recommend unless you're ok with an official substandard product that doesn't function as well as their own past devices. Sometimes I wonder if this is even an official Microsoft product.,negative
Best Xbox controller I've used,5.0,"Been gaming forever on all the Xbox console variations. This by far is the most comfortable and responsive of all the controllers. But what cliches it for me is the textured grips. I've always preferred the texture grips but the older ones had rubberized grips that would eventually 'peel' away. Not only is the design part of the molded handle - it's the entire handle, not just the inside area. I love this controller - the feel of the buttons are better than the other versions.How it holds up to gaming after weeks and months or years - remains to be seen.But I bought TWO (white & black) when they were on sale for a great price!",positive
Xbox One compatibility is very bad,1.0,"Battery cover is different than Xbox one controller so your rechargeable battery  does not fit with a cover on it unless you use a dremel and ""modify"" the cover for this one to fit rechargeable batterys. Next... it keeps disconnecting (not powering off, just disconnecting temporarily)  from Xbox one randomly unless it's pointed right at the device.  Super annoying.  All in all the compatibility with XB1 sucks.",negative
Great controller until it drifts.,2.0,"Before I picked this controller up, I had been using the controller that came with the Project Scorpio Edition controller. It started drifting forward and the A button wouldn't respond unless you Smashed it. Got this controller and it was great. Buttons responded well and no Drifting. 6 months later, I'm playing much less video games and the controller is already drifting forward. Love the Xbox Controller but the drifting is ridiculous. I've owned many Playstation controllers since the PS1 days till PS4 days and had never had any controller drifting on those. For the price they're asking, you'd expect it to last a few years at least. I'm not about to pay crazy prices for the Elite controller. Guess I'll just have to suck it up and live with this controller drifting forward in-game on its own.",negative
5 weeks in and the Bluetooth is not working,1.0,"Controller worked great for the first five weeks. Wouldn't you know it, one week after the return window is up and it becomes nothing more than a really expensive paperweight. I was literally in the middle of a game when suddenly the controller lost all connectivity to the console. The light remained solid as if it were still synced and working properly, but it will not communicate with the console. I have tried every troubleshooting measure to no avail. It will not even work plugged in via cable. I would just avoid this controller all together. Seriously disappointed in amazon for not offer either a larger window for returns or at least a option to purchase some type of protection plan on a $60 item. Absolutely ridiculous to spend that much and not even get two months of use out of it.",negative
Less than 5 months old and already broken. Bought a second lasted two months. Crap!,2.0,"My last controller lasted for years and year. Used daily by both my teenage son, all his friends as well as myself. I'd always joke, that they should make everything out of Xbox controllers, given the abuse it took and just kept on working.This may just be a $70 lemon, (I hope so). The issue is left stick is either stuck forward, or just won't move forward. You move it forward and your character just stands there or if you need to stand still you just keep inching forward. Very frustrating when playing almost every game, especially one online, when a split second can make all the difference.It's even more frustrating, because I need to now buy a new controller, from the same company since this controller is just out of warranty.Gook luck, I hope your purchase is not this bad.PS: figured this was a lemon. Went to BestBuy. Bought another one. Lasted less than two months.",negative
Better than my Xbox One controller,5.0,"I've been a Xbox for a while, but when it comes to last generation, Xbox One controllers were the same and problematic with me. I wanted to see if the Xbox Series X/S made it better.I noticed that this is a good upgrade if you Xbox One controller fails/breaks.I have a feeling that this will last longer than the Xbox One controller. It's more comfortable, durable, ergonomic, compact, and lighter than my Xbox One controller.I prefer plastic triggers instead of gloss triggers, it felt less harsh on my fingers. Same with bumpers. Buttons were the same. The D pad is luxurious and it is using the same plastic material. Kind of looks like the Xbox Elite controller. I like the share button, but I don't really use it, since I’m on PC using this. The analog sticks are still stiff like last generation, so my solution is to add grips on the sticks. Sync button is the same. They removed the slope segment next to the Xbox button. It uses USB C, which is less fragile than micro usb for charging.This is very neat of an upgrade. I could access all buttons easily, due to the size of this controller. No issues (Stick drift, sticky buttons, squeaky trigger, etc) have been reported, I started. This generation improved the controller.",positive
The best controller for PC,5.0,"This is the best controller for PC. I purchased this controller because I had signed up for a $1 introductory offer for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate as well as for a month of PlayStation Now and was surprised that this controller works for playing games via PlayStation Now. Not only does it work for playing via PlayStation now, the vibration feature when playing via PlayStation Now works as well and I did not think that being that this is an Xbox controller it would work with PlayStation Now. The only thing that does not work is motion controls but that is because this controller does not support motion controls but I knew that before buying this controller so its not an issue. My only issue is that I have no way of knowing how much battery is left as this controller works via USB or Bluetooth with 2aa batteries.",positive
"Works well, although I still prefer the feel of the Xbox 360 controller",4.0,"No complaints at all on how this controller functions.  It connects to bluetooth fine on my Windows 10 PC.  All the buttons do what they're supposed to do, although the A, B, X, Y buttons are louder than what I'm used to.I've been using the same Xbox 360 launch controller for years.  Recently it started dropping connection so I decided it's time for an upgrade.  The Core controller is slightly smaller and the grips are at a sharper angle, and after a long gaming session I feel like my hands are cramping up.  The difference in size and shape is small, but I never felt like that with the 360 controller.  I'm hoping I'll get used to it over time.It would be also nice if MS stops trying to sell play and charge kits and makes their controllers rechargeable.  By the time I bought a decent set of batteries I played close to $80 total.  Using standard AAs the price will be way more than that over time.",positive
Connection Problems,1.0,"Disconnects every 2-3 seconds while playing SOME games. Has several comfort improvements over older models, but this defect is a dealbreaker. This may be a problem with the OG Xbox One console, but would still be considered a huge compatibility issue.",negative
DOES NOT WORK WITH PC,1.0,"Arrived today connects via bluetooth to my pc but every game I tried it does not work. Xbox, Steam, Epic nothing. Very dissappointed. Controller wise it definitely looks and feels better than the one in the hands",negative
"Not bad, but not great",3.0,"This is a better version of the Xbox 360 controller. It feels solid and performs decent. Problems arise because the buttons stick. Especially the A button... how do you mess up a controller and have buttons sticking in 2021? Next, AA battery compartment? WTF is wrong with you Microsoft? Just put a battery in there... make it last somewhere competitively with the Dual Sense! I also have a PS5 controller, both of which I use on PC/mobile. Dual Sense by far the better controller.Pros:Connects with easePerforms with Gamepass and mobileSolid BuildCons:Buttons stick (unacceptable)Must use AA batteries (just pathetic)High price vs competition that is better hardwareButton sounds are loud and can annoy people, like my GF who can't stand it.",neutral
Bit of s letdown,4.0,"The controller part is just like the last iteration of the XBox controller. The feel and comfort is all the same, less a slightly smaller frame. The Bluetooth side of it is another story.  The new controller takes about 5 to 10 times longer to connect and does not always reliably do so. It will forget its link when turned off from time to time and. It does have a nice feature that tells you on the connect screen in Windows 10, how much charge the controller that won't connect has, so at least you know it's not the batteries. The last generation was awesome but this just can't fill it's shoes.",positive
I question if this is a genuine  Xbox controller,4.0,This controller  is not compatible with the rechargeable battery packs that I have been using (purchased from Microsoft when I bought my system)  because the retaining clips are in the wrong place.I have attached a picture of two original battery covers that fit this controller (white) and the controller that came with my system (black) laid back to back.  My system is an Xbox One..  Notice the position of the tabs on the vertical edge of the cover. The black cover is from my original controller that came with my Xbox system.  The tabs on the top (vertical  edge) are almost all the way out to the edge of the cover on the white cover for this new controller they are a little toward the center of the cover.,positive
Such a tough time.,3.0,"I bought this controller to play Minecraft PVP through Bluetooth. For around 2 weeks, it was fine. But it then told me I needed to update the firmware. I downloaded the Xbox accessories app from the Microsoft store, but using the usb cable wouldn’t actually connect the controller to the PC. I contacted support and plenty of subreddits to try and fix this issue, but I ended up just leaving it alone. Turns out, my windows laptop needed a update that came out first for Windows 10 Pro, and I had Windows 10 Home. I waited around 2 days, and I was able to update my laptop and update my controller. It’s just weird that an update to update a gaming controller is first only enabled in a “pro” (professional) version of an OS.",neutral
"Good for the most part, minus the whole rechargeable battery issue, etc",4.0,"The product is great for the most part. Not a big fan that I paid 70 dollars for a controller that doesn't have grips on the back even though it's the same price as the last gen ""pro"" controller for the Xbox One.Also, the rechargeable battery cover DOES NOT fit in this new controller, even though it looks exactly the same other than the 'share' button. So, unless you don't want a backing protecting your batter from falling out or getting damaged, I wouldn't try it. They force you to have to buy a new rechargeable battery.Overall, not super happy. It plays well and looks good, so that is something, but the missing features and lack of rechargeability from the previous gen battery, is super lame, especially when the new gen controller costs just as much as the previous gen when it first came out. Making it so a controller I bought like 2 years ago is better than this one, that I just bought.",positive
Excellent controller...but don't forget the adapter!!,3.0,"I decided to buy one of these after I could no longer purchase more of the Amazon Basics Xbox controllers that I loved so dearly. Those were wired anyways though (REALLY wish they were still around! Glad I bought two when I did!), so this seemed like the best option for a wireless one regardless. I got the Xbox Core Controller in Carbon Black.*Pay attention to which model you get, they are NOT all the same!*The Core Controller is different than the others, or so I have seen in reviews and video showcases on these. The Core version feels like you'd expect first party hardware to feel. It's very comfortable (surpasses the 360 Controller and Amazon Basics one IMO) and adding in the batteries gives it a nice, solid weight. One of the downsides with most 3rd party controllers is how much life or wear and tear the parts can take, in particular the joysticks. The AB wired controller I used was getting some issues with joystick drift and directional recognition over time, so I will be careful in watching this one for the same problem, but thus far it has been great.**THIS PART IS VERY IMPORTANT!!**Unfortunately, though the controller is nice and uses AA batteries (which I don't count against it), it feels like this controller is an incomplete package. I have an Asus Bluetooth adapter that I have used with several controllers and experienced no issues at all, usually with 8BitDo controllers. I've had no problems with connectivity in the least and have good line-of-sight when on my couch since I use a USB hub under the TV. This controller kept CONSTANTLY disconnecting, even after closing the applications like people suggested, moving the adapter to within 1.5 FEET of me, and all the other hullabaloo some people say has worked for them....none of that has done the job.The only real solution people have cited, which is the most plug-and-play solution, is the official ""Xbox Wireless Adapter for Win 10"" they make. Not a 3rd party knockoff, the original 1st party one. That adapter does give you other options like syncing a headset with it too, and people say they had no problems with doing both at the same time, but for running a single controller a distance this short, I find it rather worrysome that the only thing that works is a 1st party peripheral just to get this to function. Now you can run it wired, but why on Earth would you pay this much just to plug it up like you can with a cheaper version? It really seems like an incomplete package, and I realize this is first and foremost supposed to work with the Xbox, but it's a Microsoft device and I feel this should be considered just as much a product for PC as for the Xbox....and it should work just the same as any other bluetooth device would.The adapter is the only real reason I can't give this a full-on 5 star rating. While I prefer AA batteries, the optional rechargeable pack they have is another $20 or so and paired with the necessary adapter, you're already past the cost of a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller which is arguably just as comfortable (if not more), has a GREAT rechargable lithium-ion battery built in, and works with regular bluetooth receivers IME. I decided on buying the Xbox controller for wide controller support on Steam, plug and play functionality with Windows, and its comfort. Unfortunately as the package sits you only get 2 out of the 3.But if this is for an Xbox console or you already have the USB wireless receiver, this is a great controller. Just save yourself the hassle and either get the package deal (controller + receiver) or buy them separate. Would also like to see the more exotic colors on the Core Controller and not at such crazy prices. Another $10-20 for mere aesthetics seems a bit much IMO. Still a very comfy controller though. I recommend getting some rechargable AAs and getting that adapter to have a killer gaming experience.",neutral
"I was slightly skeptical at first, but I'm glad I got this newer model.",5.0,"I was hesitant about buying a newer model controller as I don't exactly like the visual design as much as the previous models produced for the Xbox One, but it only took about a day for me to love the feel of this controller the most so far. There have only been slight and subtle changes in ever version since the original that released back in 2013, but with each new change comes improvements you can feel and they feel good.The updated bumpers, D-Pad, triggers, addition of a slightly textured grip on most of the body, a share button and USB-C make this controller feel like a whole new experience for me. I don't even use my old controllers anymore and just leave them on my shelf for display at this point. Microsoft somehow managed to improve upon a design that many already claimed was the best out there and I am glad I took the chance and bought this new model.",positive
Love my new xbox controller.,5.0,"I got this to replace one od my xbox one controllers. I love the design of the controller. Works great on Xbox One, Computer, and/or Xbox Series X/S. Love the new button for capturing, makes it easy to not have to pull up menu to capture. Just press it and keep playing. Would recommemd this controller to anyone looking to modernize there xbox controllers. Also love the gripped triggers and lb/rb buttons. Makes it not as sweaty.",positive
A nice upgrade,5.0,Coming from a generation one XB1 controller this is a huge improvement. The entire controller is textured is a way that greatly improves grip over the last couple more smooth body versions. The thumb sticks have a new level of grip that i love and the d pad has raised edges giving it an almost bowl like design that really improves control. All this in a slightly slimmer profile and the shock blue looks great. I don’t use the extra share button so I can’t speak about it but it does play just as well on a PC via Bluetooth. My only gripe is the entire controller isn’t blue. The battery door and a large portion on the back of the controller is white. The white is textured like the rest so there’s no difference in grip but it does look a little off. Still a great controller.,positive
Very decent controller but is it a knock off or legitimate Xbox,4.0,"Came in and in good order, Will up date laterThis controller is a blast over the only version, and yes you Xbox plug and play battery will work in this one but you will need the USB C to charge it.Otherwise you can just get the cradle for the controllerUpdate 07/15/2021So my D pad starting acting up. Now this could be from me getting food or dirt stuck in the D pad (but I was doing my best to keep my hands clean). So now when I play first person shooter games or any game my controller starts to go up and it’s own.Since it’s to late to return the controller I will have to open it up and see what the issue is . I will post a update when I do. Other then that random crap it’s a decent controller.",positive
Trash,1.0,"Right out of the box, it doesn’t work properly. I got it to sync to my Xbox. But then a few minutes into playing it kept disconnecting and reconnecting, disconnecting and reconnecting. Over and over by itself, making it impossible to play. I changed the batteries, synced it again, made sure it was up to date... nothing changed it. Piece of trash.",negative
Might move over to PS or PC,1.0,"First off, I bought a controller from Microsoft 3 months ago. It took some hours of use but broke after 3 months. Ok, I game a lot so be it. Let me buy another so I wound up getting this POS.1) Box was ripped open and taped back up2) should have been a sign that others have had unpleasant experiences.3) didn’t come with batteries which said it would4) stated it doesn’t come with a cord but given that it’s not a micro USB they probably should throw it in so people can actually use this stupid thing.5) browsing Playstations currently.What a joke this experience has been.",negative
Pretty much does it all,5.0,"Full disclosure - I don’t use this with an Xbox. I use this controller mostly through an Apple TV for steam link purposes. That said, it works excellently via Bluetooth - great ergonomics and the color pops. I bought this controller to run through my Apple TV, PC, and mobile devices and it works great.",positive
Money buys Quality is not the case here!,2.0,"Sadly returned this controller a week after using. I gave it two stars because of the grip added to the controller and button layout. However, microsoft is using the cheapest parts on the market. When comparing this to my Day One controllers, which still currently work (only got this for the 3.5 jack), the new controller just shows how it can break after a month or two. The parts feel thinner, especially on the bumpers, the analog sticks are so sensitive that drift issues are bound to start after a couple months of use, and the d-pad is cool with the new layout but just ins’t great for precision. Sad to see Microsoft not only use cheaper quality parts, but also up the price! Unreal.",negative
New design has made the bumpers stupid fragile.,1.0,"I've had my controller for 36 days which is 6 days past my return window conveniently. So yeah if you're thinking of ""upgrading"" to the new generation of controllers or adding one to your new console, I'd strongly recommend reconsidering, and instead seek out an OG XBOX One controller. At least until the third party parts suppliers can catch up to the demand for repair parts for these sorry pieces of hardware. Because right now I cant find anything for these things, so I suppose I'm just SOL on this controller and will need to buy a replacement to fill the gap until parts start appearing for sale so I can replace the broken bumper button.",negative
Refund,1.0,I just got my controller today. First thing I did was to put on the batteries. One hour later I notice my xbox controller didn't want to turn on. I look at battery compartment and this is what I see. Very disappointed.,negative
"Easy to use, but lacks some features",4.0,"This controller connects effortlessly to PCs and Xbox consoles, but this particular kit does not feature rechargeable batteries nor a USB cable for when the included AAs run out of power. While, on paper, this controller seems more affordable than the latest Sony gamepad, the cost of supplying your own batteries and tethering cable actually make this one MORE expensive in the long run. The benefit of being able to replace your own batteries and use this gamepad with PCs without 3rd-party software is quite nice, but be aware that you will need to additional gear to use it long-term.",positive
"Mostly a refinement of the Xbox One controller, but with two adjustments I like a lot",5.0,"The controller feels a little bit smaller than the Xbox One controllers.  The grips, triggers, and bumpers are textured now.  The biggest differences are the d-pad and the new share button.  The share button makes it easier to take screenshots - not a huge addition, but nice if you like taking screenshots.  The best change is that the d-pad is now 8-way as opposed to the cross design the Xbox One controllers had.  This is much better for games that rely on diagonals or circle motions, especially fighting games such as Soul Calibur, Tekken, Dead or Alive, Mortal Kombat, Killer Instinct, and more.  The cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) are also raised and angled so that it's still easy to be precise when using the d-pad.  The build quality also seems better than it was during the Xbox One days, plus the controller can be used for Xbox One, Xbox Series, and PC.  I still recommend buying at least two just in case and for local multiplayer.Overall, it's the best version (so far) of what we've been getting since the Controller S back in the OG Xbox days.",positive
"Poor quality, failed within two weeks",1.0,"This controller failed to work after only about two weeks of use. Unfortunately, i gave it as a gift for my grandson and he told me it failed but I didn't apply for a return until two days too late....! So we are stuck with this failed product. I am not buying anything but books from Amazon in the future because of no guarantees and because there is no way to predict quality from a third-party vendor.",negative
4 months 2 dead controllers (Microsoft get your act together),1.0,The first controller had a trigger sticking after one month. The second controller had the left bumper fail after 3 months. I like the design but the quality on this is horrible. The first one I was able to return but this next one I might not be able to return. I am playing on PC and I had been using an old Wii U controller I had laying around the house. And it still works after all these years. What's the deal with this controller? Isn't this basically the same design as the Xbox One controller. Microsoft you should have figured out the quality by now.,negative
Not really enjoying this new model,4.0,"The overall shape is the same as previous models but it has like a textured grip that I’m not very fond of. Additionally, the Joystix were like super sticky and they still are. I’ve had this for about a month now and even after cleaning the Joystix still have like a stick to them which is super annoying.Also, the triggers are really comfortable when pulling them but don’t seem to have the same response time as my previous controller. I have to Press much harder and faster on the trigger.Pretty disappointed with this controller. Thinking about returning and just purchasing the pro",positive
Windows 10 Creator Update and Bluetooth LE,1.0,"I purchased this controller after a button broke on the Xbox controller that I had been using since 2018.This product may be just fine for most people but on three PCs in my house these controllers do not work.Each computer has native Bluetooth. No dongles were used.This controller will connect and seem to be working.After a few moments or worse when you in the middle of an intense sequence the controller will disconnect.Prior to returning this controller for a replacement I did the mandatory searching to see if this was a known problem. From what I've gathered there was an issue with Bluetooth LE drivers after the Windows 10 Creator Update and the problem persists on my three PCs.Let me be sure to make it clear that every remedy was attempted to solve this problem prior to returning this controller, twice. Yes, I returned this controller TWICE. The replacement had the same issue.1. Newest drivers from several sources. (Windows Update, Manufacturer and OEM)2. Rolled back drivers (3 versions back from newest) from several sources (Windows Update, Manufacturer and OEM)3. Several registry changes to force Bluetooth LE to disallow power saving features.4. Fresh clean install of Windows 10 completely offline so that bad driver couldn't be automatically installed.None of the above solutions worked.The old controller I am trying to replace continued to connect and remain connected with each iteration of troubleshooting.This could just be a Bluetooth LE issue that may be resolved in the near future but the problem is bad enough that I spent an extra $30 more to purchase the older version of this controller.",negative
Box Destroyed inside a Sealed Amazon Packaging Bags,4.0,"As you can see from the photos, the box is damaged to the point the tape that seals the box is broken. The Amazon “bag” it came with is sealed though. I’m surprised they sent it via Amazon plastic package bags instead of a box. Maybe cheaper that way. I tested the controller, needed an update just like the first time you use your Carbon Black Controller that came with the console. It works fine. Now I have a Robot white and a carbon black controller. I still use my old One X controllers, not the one that came with the console, that broke immediately! 4 stars because the box looked liked it’s a Capitol Security Guard and got rushed and trampled.",positive
"PC Bluetooth disconnects constantly, stick drags after months",1.0,"You'd think in 2021 a newer Gen console controller would have figured out Bluetooth, but nope. This ruined so many matches for me by disconnecting every 5-10 minutes from my pc and taking 5-10 seconds to reconnect. Sometimes, it would say it reconnected but the controller wouldn't work and you'd have to manually turn off the controller (hold button for 6 seconds) and then wait a few seconds before turning it back on to reconnect.It's just not viable. Idk how Microsoft can't know about this (it's on multiple help forums) and it's still not patchedAlso! Now after owning it for 6 months, one of the sticks when pulled back continues to input backwards movement after releasing for a couple seconds. Game breaking",negative
Great controller but isn’t working with Apple IOS currently,5.0,Love this remote but I haven't really gotten to use it because I got it for my iPad and iPhone to play games but this particular controller has Bluetooth connection and unfortunately Apple’s IOS hasn’t fixed the connection issue with this particular Xbox remote. If I had gotten the Xbox one remote it would have connected with no issues. So I’m just waiting for Apple to update their IOS so I can use this as planned.,positive
"Better than last Gen, only one small problem....",5.0,"It feels better than the last generation of Xbone controllers because of a ton of little tweaks : finger grip texture on the shoulder buttons and under the chassis (where you hold on with your last 3 fingers), charging plug is now a USB Type C (thank you Jesus) and uses the same one as my phone for convenience, share button is actually useful bu default and can be remapped to any button....😎👌All good except for my one complaint : the battery packs from the last gen controller don't fit (and only barely, you can tape it in and it WORKS, it just looks like crap having tape on a brand new controller.🤔😰Other than that tiny thing, it's a solid 95%/100! Highly recommended!👍😎👍",positive
A Great New Controller,5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for; my last controller lost the rubber end on the joystick and the buttons had begun to stick, so I took to Amazon in search of a new controller, this one caught my eye and I impulsively ordered it. I wasn't disappointed, I was actually pleasantly surprised. The controller has a C-Type plugin whereas my old one had a micro-usb, which is perfect because my new phone also uses C-Type. The color scheme actually is reminiscent of something you'd see from Nintendo, kinda, which isn't accusatory or anything. It's just the way the white, red, and black color scheme goes together that makes me think that, but it's great. The buttons are responsive and the feel is fantastic, it's comfortable to hold. I've only had a few worrisome times where the controller wouldn't connect to my Xbox but I restarted my console and it seemed to fix that issue. Great purchase, and worth my time.",positive
junk,1.0,I bought it for xbox one and it turns off all the time I do not understand how it got high ratings I did try to replace it but it does the same thing.,negative
It does the job and looks good buuuuuut....,5.0,"I got this controller because the Blue looks great and reminds me of Sonic. 😁. I got it to play games on PC and it works well.As for the feel of the controller, I have an XBOX One controller and to me that one feels a lot more solid and has a better build quality feel.  The X controller to me has that plsasticy feel and look.  Something about the shiny parts of the One controller that gives it a higher quality look.  I also like the One Controllers D pad better.All that said, it looks good and works well.",positive
Ergonomic design and universally great to use - Could have more premium build though,4.0,"I've used the Xbox controllers for years now, and I've loved them-  especially as an upgrade from the Xbox 360 controllers. The new share button is a nice addition, but I'm not a huge fan of the updated D-pad. It feels like it is a little cheaper and less sturdy than the prior model of this controller. The controller also feels like the weight is not as evenly distributed as my previous controllers as well. I do however very much like the textured backing that helps grip the controller better than the previously smooth models. I use this controller for gaming on my Xbox One X and on with my Apple TV for some casual gaming and streaming my Xbox to my iPad, and it works so well with all of the devices and switches very easily. I wish that the controller had more updates to it the way the PS5 Dualshock controller did with the generational update, but that doesn't take away from the current pluses. Overall, a great controller that I would definitely recommend for gaming with Xbox and other devices (mobile, PC, etc).",positive
"It works, but something is wrong",2.0,"I thought I had ordered a brand new controller  but this one seems to have issues with the buttons and anolog sticks. Sometimes the xbox controller will not let me depress the buttons enough to actually execute the action necessary for each button. It is like I never pressed it at all, but I've pressed it several times. The sticks stick and don't move as freely as they should. I thought if I used them more they would become more flexible and that I just needed to break them in, that is not the case and I don't know what is.",negative
D pad is much improved over the One S controller. Buttons are much louder,5.0,"I've been using this controller with an Xbox One X for over a month now. This controller is a significant improvement over the One S controller, if you play games that use the D pad. I like to play platformers, and this new D pad is much more comfortable than the old one: you can go left to right quickly without lifting up your finger, and you won't accidentally slip off.The controller's D pad, LB, and RB are more clickly, so they feel better to use, but they are significantly louder. The controller is much more grippy, which feels nice. It is actually a bit smaller than the old controller.",positive
"Newer Model, Same Issues",2.0,"Ever have stick drift?  Yup, not improved in this model.  I've only had this controller for about two months and the left stick is just starting to drift.  Most of the controllers I have purchased for the Xbox have worn out the same way, sticks go bad.  I also do not like the share button, sometimes when hitting the ""start"" button, I accidentally hit the share button.  Annoying to say the least.  I wish they made the stick modules easy to swap out since they wear out so easily.Other than that, seems to work okay...",negative
"Great product, but in the end I spent $17 more when a new one in person is $45.99; does work great!",5.0,"After a small discrepancy on the initial order (requested free Prime 2-day shipping and initially the delivery date was 10 days out, but it was ordered late on a Saturday and by Monday the due date was the coming Thursday and it arrived a day early) it quickly sorted itself out.  The controller is phenomenal.  Terrific grip, fantastic button/bumper/trigger response, sits lightly but firmly in hand, and the color is better in person.  I would like to point out that wireless controller were only $45.99 here in town, but every detail store was out and wouldn't be stocked for a few days.  Normally a different color is more, but I thought the price hike was a little steeper in the end.  Could have bought one for $17 cheaper on Monday.  I am very satisfied with my order, but thought I would point out the price differences I faced.  Thanks for a great product!",positive
"Build Quality is great, but must be wired",3.0,"I bought this recently because my three year old xbox one controller bit the dust. My partner has the blue version of this controller, and it is constantly disconnecting and reconnecting. I figured it was a problem with her computer and bought this anyways. Nope. I play with the controller connected to my pc, but it might as well be a wired controller. It disconnects and reconnects constantly, which has caused us to die or lose a level multiple times. Haptics and everything else are great as always, but I would like to use my controller without it disconnecting constantly.",neutral
Horrible packing,1.0,Nice color. Terrible box condition for a new release  controller.,negative
"Great controller, bad shipping situation.",3.0,"3 - stars due to the container it arrived in.I'm certain the box had been opened on this specific order but the controller had not been used, as this one had batteries, which the other that I purchased lacked. I do, however, understand that this was a shipping issue. What I do not understand is how they shipped electronics without a box to protect the packaging inside a box. they sent me a regular shipping bag as opposed to a box with this order. I'm worried what others may have recieved now because of this crap shipping situation.Now for the 5 star portion of the review.Anyways, the review for the controller: It's a really good controller. Definitely a step in the right direction for an entry level microsoft controller that doesn't require you to spend 100+ dollars on. The joysticks feel nice, the primary four buttons on too feel super responsive, and the triggers and bumpers are miles ahead of the already amazing xbox one, with their addition of engraved textures into the actual plastic. If you want a good gaming controller for your windows pc or xbox, then there's once again an easy pick with the Xbox Series X's controller. Definitely a stellar purchase.",neutral
Like the new controller design,5.0,So Xbox hasn't really deviated from the previous xbox controller designs much. I like this controller design though. I like the share button. I went from being a PS4 player until this year and moving back to Xbox due to all the backwards games you can play and game pass. The controllers are easy to move back and forth from once you get use to them. I had an xbox one and then moved to a ps4 and finally now have an Xbox series S model. The good thing about xbox is they haven't changed their controllers that much over the years.,positive
"Great for phone, laptop, PC Gaming",5.0,"One of the best innovations from consoles is the controller. For action adventure, driving, flying, or platform fighting games, a mouse and keyboard just does not compete with the controller. And the xbox wireless controller is awesome. The wireless connection always stays stable and as all it needs are AA batteries, I feel like it can last me for ever. Also, the controller works like a wired keyboard as it can except a usb-c charge and sync connection. The only downside is that the controller is not hot swappable so you can not remove the switch underneath the joystick and buttons if it fails without soldering, to be able to replace all the buttons you need an xbox elite controller which is too high a price to pay if you ask me.",positive
"Minor Improvements, Good Value",5.0,"If you had an Xbox One Controller, you'll be right at home with the updated version. Works great with the series S. I definitely notice a lower input lag on these versus the original xbox one controller. The grippy feel is nice and comfortable. The new direction pad feels great. The highlight for me, is that these feel a little better made than the original Xbox One controllers. The bumpers feel good and don't stick. The only issue I had with the older line was non responsive bumpers, and these seem to be holding up better with no signs of wear yet.Definitely recommend the new line of controllers.",positive
"Amazing controller, fast delivery  and definitely a steal for the price!",5.0,"Great fit, love the grips and very easy to set up. Feels good in your hands and the buttons are really responsive.

There is ZERO good reason to have to buy new controllers 4 times a year.",negative
Constantly disconnects,1.0,"Disappointed in this xbox controller. Bought it to play a PC game but it constantly disconnects and loses signal.

"Excellent Controller, Much Better than Original",5.0,"I loved the feel and weight of my old Xbox 360 remote - so I was disappointed with the initial Xbox One controller. I've owned my 360 controller for a decade without any issues, but my Xbox One controller started having stick drift issues within the first 2 years of ownership. After it officially became unusable, I purchased the Xbox Core controller. What an upgrade! The Xbox Core controller feels much more balanced, with added weight and finger grips around the back and trigger buttons. I recommend this controller over the originally-provided one, hands-down.",positive
Best controller money can buy (imo)!,5.0,This controller is incredible! I purchased the pulse red color and it’s even nicer than I expected. The pictures don’t do it justice. It has a white textured back which makes it nice for long gaming sessions when my hands tend to get a little clammy. The buttons all feel great and the triggers are perfect. They are soft press but very tactile which I love! I know I’m biased but I really think Microsoft makes the best controllers on the market. Definitely worth the $60. I’ve never had an issue with any of my Xbox controllers ever. Don’t cheap out on controllers because its just not worth it in the long run. Your hands will thank you.,positive
Xbox controller scam,1.0,This deserves 0 stars. I paid for an Xbox series X carbon black controller and was sent a regular xbox controller that was used. The company put a used and destroyed controller in a Series X box. The inside of the controller looked like batteries exploded inside then it was attempted to clean it. Becareful with whos selling the product because a lot of scamming is going on.,negative
Straight-up best Xbox controller I have ever used,5.0,"I've used a number of cheaper Xbox controllers for PC, both wired and wireless. Even the Logitech F710, which cost the same, cannot compare to the Xbox Core. The build quality is very solid and I've had no issues with the button actions. I did have some issues with bluetooth connectivity, but pretty sure that's an issue with my PC. I ended up getting the wireless adapter and it works flawlessly. There are certainly cheaper options in terms of decent controllers, but I'd say the Xbox Core Controller is well worth the higher price.",positive
A nice upgrade from the XB One Controller.,5.0,"The controller itself is great. Seems a bit of a step up from the previous model (Xbox One). It isn't a knock on the item itself, but keep in mind that if you are upgrading from a rechargeable set up on an Xbox One controller that the battery cover with the charging slot IS NOT interchangeable between old a new controllers. You will need a Series X type battery cover.",positive
"Truly awful for a 60$ controller, bad connectivity, bad compatability",1.0,"I've had the controller and used it for a few weeks now. I have to main issues with it that each on its own would be a deal breaker. First off the controller frequently loses Bluetooth connection. I have updated the drivers with no luck for staying connected to my PC happens for a moment every 10-15 minutes or so. The other issue I have is it does not work with some games. The main game I've had issues with is Forza Horizon 4. The game always crashes on the results screen when using the controller over Bluetooth. When it is wired or I use a different controller it works fine.I cannot put this strongly enough. Avoid this controller, while it is physically nice the software support from Microsoft has been nothing short of terrible.",negative
Do not risk buying used! Chance of being scammed.,1.0,"I purchased this controller in the ""Used: Like New"" condition, I received the correct box, but inside was a first generation Xbox one controller, ""the one without Bluetooth its so old,"" and a broken battery pack. So what appears to have happened is, whoever bought the controller first just swapped theirs out for the new one and sent their old one back and amazon looked at it and said ""Yep, looks good to me!"" even though this controller is supposed to be all white, but the one in the box was white and black. I stress again, this is just for USED controllers, I went to the store and bought a new controller and it is great.",negative
"No Wires, No Battery Pack",2.0,"It comes with OEM batteries, which causes the controller to reconnect every so often. While you're playing a game, this will absolutely ruin your experience. You'll have to order connectors and battery packs along with this controller... by that point, you mind as well simply purchase any controller but this, because the price of this would be identical if not more in the end. I technically could've gotten an Elite had I known that this product was lacking in so many components.",negative
Ok if you like breaking your fingers to mash buttons,2.0,"Let me first say that I was very excited by this controller when I first saw it.  The design is great, and it looks and feels premium.  Unfortunately, it does not perform well unless you are a button masher.  I find that a good 25% of my button presses for A and Y do not register if I don't forcefully smash the button.  I was convinced that the controller I received was defective, so I requested a replacement... but it is also doing exactly the same thing on exactly the same buttons, so I will be returning them both.  I even performed the firmware update via the Xbox Accessories app, but that did nothing to resolve the issue. This one is a big disappointment and I can only recommend that you wait for Microsoft to improve their production quality.",negative
Does not work with other BT adapters,1.0,"The controller is find by itself, but for the non-official xbox wireless adapter users out there, your BT will not work properly! You will have controller recognition and button mapping issues that makes the controller unusable. You are forced to either use it wired or purchase the official adapter for extra.This is a huge disappointment since the issue has been there since Otc 2020, yet MS is unwilling to fix it. The product description about bluetooth support is basically a lie.P.S. for the comments saying it could be fixed with Xbox Accessory App update, it is not true. Those people are likely playing games on Steam, which has an build-in driver that somehow gets around this issue. For any games outside of Steam, you have to either add them to Steam library, otherwise you are out of luck.",negative
Sometimes loses connectivity,4.0,"I play a lot of video games and eventually the buttons start to wear out. So I decided to buy this replacement. It took a while for it to pair with my Xbox One. More so than the previous controller. Which was kind of off putting. But eventually it locked on and it seemed to be working fine. However, periodically it will lose connectivity and I will have to take the batteries out and put them back in to get it to restart. Just be aware if that might be an issue for you",positive
Passable,3.0,"Love the feel of it but does not work with my recharge system, they changed the battery door. Doesn't have the same range as my other wireless controllers. Does not use the same usb cord so I can't use it wired. But as long as I'm willing to put money into batteries or buy a different cord for my ( wireless ) controller, which is what I'll do, it's fine. Thanks Microsoft",neutral
"Bad, Bad, and just BAD. All around BAD experience.",1.0,"I am generally a pretty patient person when it comes to gaming hardware, as I am a pretty intense gamer and put my controllers through a lot of stress over time. But this controller is just a complete disaster. A list of issues I have are below, all within 3 months of use. MAX 150 hours put into this controller at this moment. This was the last straw for me with Microsoft, I am ready to start my journey with Sony and DualShock 4s immediately.1. Right trigger was sticking directly out of the box, I was able to fix this issue myself and haven't had any issues since, figured it could have been a fluke.2. Y button MAYBE works 75% of the time. If it does actually work, there is probably a 25% chance that it will double click.3. Over the past couple days my A button and B button both stick down now. I wash my hands before every gaming session, its not due to dirtiness. I have never had this issue before.These are literally the only buttons I use and all of them have horrible issues. Id imagine my left trigger is next to go, and If I used X I bet it would be on its way out as well.Hit up google yourself about these controllers. You will find that they are littered with problems, its truly a disgrace. I wouldn't trust the reviews here, that's what I did and this is where it got me. Good luck gamers.",negative
NOT AN UPGRADE,2.0,"Mainly it's just an ordinary controller but cheaper:Controller feels hollow, like the typical controllerThe share button (which CAN NOT be disabled!) Extremely annoying when your accidentally hitting the button and captures & screen shots go wild.Also it does NOT come with a usb-c cable.Also having trouble with the audio adapter connected to the controller, all sound will randomly cut out for nearly 10 sec (maybe the adapter but never had that problem before...😤)I waited nearly a month for this...😒",negative
Not well supported on windows 10.,2.0,"Controller has a good quality plastic shell, good quality thumb sticks, and excellent d-pad. However contact pads for face buttons are pretty terrible, and allow for buttons to be pressed without being registered. The biggest issue is with windows support, or more specifically games on windows. From my testing only about 50% of games worked fine with this controller. Some of the games keep disconnecting controller from bluetooth (e.g. Curse of the Dead Gods), or don't recognize the controller at all (e.g. Batman: Arkham Knight). I've tried using new software updates for the controller, but it still remains about as usable as it was before.So, get the older version of the controller if you really want to use the xbox controller--or get ds4 with ds4windows.",negative
Battery operated + charging cord sold separately,1.0,"Maybe I hadn't read well enough, but I didn't expect this to be battery operated or for the cable to not come with the controller. It was over $60 when I purchased it. For that amount, I expected it to work like my PS4 controller. i.e. not battery operated, comes with a charging cord, and all you need to do is plug it into your pc or console to charge it. No fuss, no muss.Personally, I wouldn't bother with this controller. It'll end up costing you around $80-90 in total to get the chords and/or rechargeable batteries.",negative
A worthy upgrade,5.0,"It's better than the Xbox One controller in nearly every way. Slightly different ergonomic design, better triggers and bumper buttons, the improved texture on the back side is welcome addition. It's the same controller, just better. Bought it for PC as my Xbox One controller sticks were getting worn out and started producing a lot of drift in some games and just like before, it's great and does the job.I see no reason to buy anything buy an Xbox Series controller for PC, it had no equal at the price point.",positive
Great PC Controller Windows 10 Bluetooth,5.0,"I had no issue connecting this controller to my computer wirelessly via Bluetooth. I did not have to use an extra adapter. I have the latest Windows 10 version with an Intel wireless Bluetooth receiver. Turn on the fully charged controller, put it into pairing mode, made sure Bluetooth was set to on in windows settings, and a notification pops up asking to pair the device. Click yes and it is successfully paired. I have used it with Amazon's Luna, Steam, and Stadia. The texture on it is a bit weird, but I was able to adjust to it quickly.",positive
"Feels great, but two months in already has stick drift. Not Happy.",1.0,"Purchased on Jan 22, already i'm experiencing stick drift making my games really hard to play and quite annoying i might say, not the best quality for the price.Update.Yeah... one star. I tested my old ""generic"" controller and sticks are still intact, i cant believe this ""OEM"" microsoft approved controller has cheaper sensors.Buyer beware.",negative
Best Controller on the market for PC,5.0,"First of all the package arrived as described. No Issues with it. Product came flawless.About the controller, is one the best joysticks on the market, I have owned the 360 and the Xbox one versions, and microsoft has done a terrific job. Here some positive things:* The texturize material for better grip.* Updated the Micro-USB to USB type C* Bluetooth Connection (Connected immediately)* Improved D-pad* Small design changes, like the Microsoft logo in the center and the share button (useless in my opinion).*Still uses AA Batteries, but im fine with it , just a matter of swaping the batteries and you can buy a rechargable package.*Support for games on PC is wide, almost all of the games I have has native configuration. (GTA5, Shadow of war, Fifa20, ETS2,etc...)Overall im very satisfied with the purchase. I would recommend it if you need a controller , especially for PC.",positive
The seal was opened,4.0,"The seal to the box was opened before I even grabbed a knife to open the product. I'm not sure if I was given a refurbished product or not but everything seems to be okay for the most part for now. If anything happens in the time between now (7/31/21) and the return date, I'll revise this review. The product feels good and is responsive and etc. I'll go into more detail in my revised review, either after the 30 days or if I need to return the product within the return date.",positive
Dead stick after warranty ended.,3.0,"I purchased this controller to be mine alone. None of my kids were allowed to touch it - I just wanted one controller in the house that wasn’t sticky.Two weeks after the 90 day warranty was up, the left stick developed a dead zone and no longer registered “up”. Now I’m back to playing on my grubby falling-apart-yet-still-working-perfectly eight year old controllers. That’s disappointing.Also, my rechargeable battery packs didn’t fit this new design for some reason. That’s on me I guess, but worth mentioning.",neutral
Causes issues for us constantly using with Xbox one,4.0,I love this controller it feels nice in your hands we like the screenshot button but of course every time they upgrade a gaming system or phone they change the plugs the battery packs and everything else so it is not interchangeable with any charging system or battery packs we already have for the rest of our controllers for Xbox one so we had to go out and buy all special charging cables and new battery packs and controller backs for this one controller I honestly wish I just would’ve bought another Xbox one controller,positive
Quality has gone down hill. Buy a protection plan if you buy any controllers. You’ll be needing it.,1.0,Microsoft has really lost their touch. The controller looks and feels great but the buttons stick and the left thumb stick drifts slightly. I’ve had this controller for about a month now and it was like this out of the box. The A and Y buttons require a pretty hard press to even register. If you lightly press the buttons they won’t work. This is my third controller in the last 3 years. If you’re lucky 1 year will be the lifespan for yours as well. Extremely disappointed.UPDATE: it’s been 3 months and It’s already halfway useless. The buttons won’t register unless you press them hard. Any light press and you’ll get nothing. This is unforgivable as this is my second Microsoft controller in a year. I also keep my controllers clean and free of dirt. I don’t know what Microsoft is doing but I miss the quality of Xbox 360 controllers. You could run one over with a car and it would still work.,negative
Works fairly well... when wired.,4.0,"Bluetooth had issues on my PC. Not sure if that's the PC's bluetooth chipset or what, but it took a lot of tries to sync, and after a while, the signal cut out.Kinda annoying that it doesn't ship with a cable too.Still, the controller is comfortable. Most every game on PC these days just works with it.The d-pad is quite nice and works well for me when playing fighting games, although it's also extremely loud.",positive
Great quality but doesn't fit all battery pack options,4.0,"The grips are great not too coarse as to agitate your hand after hours of use but enough to make the controller not slippery when your hands are sweaty. My only issue is we have the x-one rechargeable battery packs & the mold is narrow to fit the battery pack (photos older controller upgrade grey, new one that I'm reviewing is blue). So we will have to snap the tabs or buy new battery packs which I'm not stoaked about. Besides that the controls are all very smooth & i like the texture triggers!",positive
Good Controller,5.0,"Pros: solid constructions (no flex), great micro grip texture, bumpers work so far, the elite style d pad shape is greatCons: triggers don’t provide feedback like the old model, dpad can be too clicks for retro games.Overall great controller, just works via Bluetooth. Recommend over the old version for sure.",positive
Frequently Disconnects from Console,2.0,"I use this controller with an Xbox One console. While playing games the controller will disconnect from the console on its own, sometimes momentarily sometimes rapidly over and over in rapid succession. I have received a replacement controller but this one does the same thing. At times I find myself using my old Xbox One controller to avoid the hassle. The Series X controller disconnects a lot while playing Modern Warfare and Cold War. So far I haven't been able to locate any support on how to properly fix this issue.",negative
Best controller for metroidvanias so far using the thumbstick... But...,4.0,"After around two months of heavy use, I've found it starts getting loose like most of the controllers are on initial buy. Meaning if you flick the thumbstick, it turns the character the opposite way you initially intended. Stuff like Axiom Verge, ESA, Bloodstained all rely on tight controls, and while it started nicely, it has definitely gotten some wear and is causing issues.If you can use the DPAD for those games, do so, but it's really just so much more comfortable with sticks...",positive
Standard Xbox Core Controller,4.0,"What can I say? It works like it's supposed to. Came with an Xbox subscription promo, 2 brand name copper and black batteries, and some terrible instructions. Satisfactory packaging, though my box was slightly dented, there was zero damage to the contents. 4 stars because I feel like the standard price of these products are inflated and predatory.",positive
A button sticks right out of box(bought new!),1.0,"Just got this for my pc. From the very first press of the A button, it was getting stuck! Tried pressing it a few times and it seems to correct itself but after a few presses gets slightly suck over and over again. Going to have to return this as this is inexcusable for something deemed ""new"" right out of box with zero use. Not sure if this a common problem with this controller with use but something out of box, a button shouldn't be already sticking and considering it to be the most used buttons in games(A button). Very disappointed that I already have to return after having owning it for more than 20 minutes.  Overall the controller elsewhere seems nice and comfortable but unfortunately the A button sticks into controller right out of box. I suspect that this might have been a used controller marked as ""new"" as i've seen another comment where this happened to someone else for this controller. Buyer beware!",negative
Cool controller,5.0,"Feels good, not overly bulky like the old xbox controllers.  My one complaint is to turn the light on the xbox symbol down.  If you are playing in a dark room, it can seem like a car is coming at you with their brights on.  Couldn't find any configuration setting to adjust the brightness like you have on the ps4 controller, so I ended up having to take a sharpie to it.  It dulled the light but didn't completely eliminate it like I had wanted but its doable.",positive
Works great on Android and looks great,5.0,"I specifically bought this controller for use on my Android phone mounted by a phone clip for a game called Vendetta Online (if you like games with Android controller support, I highly recommend it). I don't own an Xbox and I already use a Wolverine Razor for PC gaming.Works perfectly with my phone so far and pairs without any issue. It's pretty comfortable, thumbsticks feel good have just the right amount of tension for precise control, triggers feel fine and the buttons as well as the D pad are quite clicky which I like. I really like the blue and white color combination. Overall I'm very happy with it.",positive
Had issues with lackluster and defective refurbished controllers.,2.0,"I got this used and the first one I got would disconnect multiple times per hour.  I returned it and got a replacement. The replacement stayed connected, but the buttons were very sticky and slow to pop back up. It felt like syrup or something gummy was in the controller and this made games unplayable because the buttons would stay down.I wound up returning the second controller and just buying a new one.",negative
Just buy new for a few dollars more,1.0,"Uh, I would have bought a controller that didn’t get beat up like Tina Turner when Ike was on a bender if I had known better. The few dollars I saved buying “used in excellent condition” is clearly going to come off its lifespan. Doesn’t even include the usb c cable needed to update.",negative
A Huge Improvement,5.0,"This controllers is a huge improvement from both the previous XBOX stock controller and the XBOX SPORT controller as well as the ELITE models.  This new release took the ruggedness of the stock controller, the nimbleness of the SPORT controller, and the features of the ELITE controller and put it all into this budget-friendly offering.I usually went through a controller every 3-6months and have bags of controllers...this new controller feels better than all of then, even when they were new.",positive
Yes! This controller is better than the one you're contemplating on switching up.,4.0,"Top of the line, no doubt about it.  Microsoft always comes correct with their products, this controller is no exception.  To prevent cosmetic wear n tear', consider scooping up a silicone cover for it as well as joystick covers.  Grime started accumulating in between the tiny joystick crevice grips. Took about a day to adjust from an Xbox 360 controller to really appreciate this controller.  Bit of a steep purchase compared to those other cheaper alternatives, but the difference between them is Night n Day, even for casuals.  Very well constructed and ultimately, one must decide where they want their thumbs to be when making a purchase for a video game controller.",positive
Not the best for large hands,4.0,I have very large hands. This is great if you have smaller hands than me but this is definitively worse than the previous controller. I do think the ergonomics are great but it's very much a case of essentially trying to fit your hand inside a pringles can for me.The edges under the triggers come back too much and my fingers end up resting on those edges which is uncomfortable and even cramming all my fingers together on the bottom I am still pressing against that edge which is very uncomfortable. The triggers are a touch small for me but not as big of a deal as a literal uncomfortable shape.,positive
Works as Expected,5.0,"My last controller was experiencing stick-drift so I decided to invest in a new one (this one). Works just fine, connectivity with my Xbox One S is solid, no input-eating, stick-drift, or anything that would cause issues in-game.The only issue I had was my battery packs, which fit my previous Xbox One controller, do not fit in this controller. Seems the back cases ""slits"" we'll call them are spaced closer together than my previous controller. As well as the battery packs themselves seem larger in size than on my previous controller. Therefore, the controller may be smaller in size than your everyday controller.Would recommend.",positive
Great...when it works,3.0,"Disclaimer: I bought this exclusively to play on the PC, I do not own any XBOXI'll just start with the con because it makes games unplayable.  Whenever I'm connected via bluetooth to my computer which is literally right next to me, every 5 mins or so, the connection gets disconnected and reconnected.  During this 5 seconds, you can't do anything in game, in fact if you're moving forward, it'll just keep going forward until the controller reconnects.  I spent a few hours googling to see what the issue was, and couldn't figure it out, but I'm not the only one with this problem.  My controller is fully updated, I've tried reconnecting a few times, only thing that works is to keep it attached to your PC via a cable (but what's the point of buying a wireless controller then?).Pros (assuming you don't have the connectivity issues):Looks great, feels good in the hand, well made, and responsive (again, only when it works), and simple to use.",neutral
Stopped working after a month,1.0,"Purchased in early March 2021. Died in mid-April, ONE week after our return window closed. Didn't even last two full months. Epic fail. Won't buy this one ever again.",negative
"Feels great in the hand, I ordered a second one!",5.0,"I really like this controller, the textured finish is just rough enough to get a good grip. It is a little heavier than I expected but that turned out to be a good thing! It looks good, and feels good in your hands even after hours of straight game play (Skryrim/Destiny/MHW) etc.. Liked enough to order another one as back up, But I expect this one to last for awhile, just feels like a quality piece of gear.",positive
"Great controller, more difficult to set up on PC than expected",4.0,"I'm fairly new to using controllers for PC gaming so this is an upgrade from the jenky Logitech brand I was using previously. Almost everything about this controller was a massive improvement; the D-pad is wonderfully precise, the action on the triggers is a bit longer than I expected but they're smooth and easy to press so that's not a problem, the thumbstick grips keep my thumbs in place during long sessions without becoming painful and require the perfect amount of pressure for their Z axis. My hands are on the large side but this controller seems very ergonomically versatile (probably fits lots of hand sizes) feels great to grip.For downsides, this controller is not 'plug-and-play' on PC at all. It needs to be connected with a USB-A/USB-C adapter (not included) in order to be updated so that's an additional purchase to keep in mind if you don't already have the cable. It also required me to make an account which I find annoying. That said, I have no complaints now that I have the controller set up.",positive
Trash tier,1.0,"These controllers are all trash now. Random dead buttons, buttons that stick when pressed and don't bounce back,  stick drift still and all within a couple weeks play time.  At least the last generation of garbage controllers worked for several months before they died.",negative
Long delivery for a piece of garbage.,2.0,"Delayed repeatedly, controller box is damaged, the controller is covered in dust, i ordered new not used but this looks potentionally used given the high amount of dust coating it. Doesn't work with headset. The back pannel doesnt fit. Just trash",negative
The official wireless controller now has a new button and they didn't jack up the price...,4.0,"This is the official Microsoft wireless controller for Xbox - now with a brand new button! There actually are some other differences compared to the older model. I can definitely feel a better grip as the plastic is textured on the handles. Also the d-pad is nicer. Although the new button is not a revolution in gaming, it does make it more convenient to take screenshots and video clips. Sometimes I hit the button by accident so I get a few more screenshots than I want. So this new revision is a little bit better and considering that they didn't jack up the price, I recommend it.",positive
PC users listen up,5.0,"Ordered the Shock Blue wireless controller and it came earlier than expected, box was in perfect condition. I did not use this for an Xbox, but for Steam on my pc. If you plan on getting this for a laptop or pc, you do not need Xbox accessories to use the controller, only to configure the buttons and check if the controller and it’s functions work properly. To use this in steam, make sure your controller is connected via Bluetooth to your computer. If you don’t have any batteries and plan on using a USB-C cable, then the following instructions don’t apply to you, you’re good to go if you use a cable. If you plan on connecting via Bluetooth, then listen up. Go to steam’s settings, click Controller, then click on Controller Setting’s. After that, place a check mark in the designated box of your controller. So you would check the Xbox One Controller box. After that, you’ll be good to play wireless. Just make sure the game you’re playing is controller supported or you’ll need to use a keyboard and mouse. Besides that, controller feels great, buttons and joysticks are very quiet. The textured grips are nice and the overall look of the controller is very aesthetically pleasing. Buy the controller and give it a try: 10/10",positive
Not the bargain controller you would expect,5.0,"This being the cheapest Microsoft Xbox controller(robot white), it surprisingly has very crisp controls comparatively to my older pubg edition controller with wicked stick drift. It also has a very nice rough kind of texture on the back that makes it nice to play on during intense battles on apex legends with a bunch of sweats in ranked.Save ur money on the fancy custom edition controllers with no extra features, they will end up with stick drift anyway and just buy this one. I've been gaming extensively with this controller for a few months now and I can honestly say it's been doing its job and holding up as it should. I will be buying the same controller if it's available when this one breaks naturally or when it gets tossed through the drywall after getting mopped up by some sweats with smurf accounts. Hope this helps!",positive
Signal get lost,3.0,"The controller is okay, the quality feels so good buttons and pads and it is so comfortable, however while I’m playing some times it just stops working and the light starts blinking, it comes back to normal after few seconds so my guess is that the signal gets lost and it is trying to reconnect, batteries are new so that’s not the problem, I definitely don’t recommend this one for online games, I haven’t tried it using a cable though but if I have to use the cable then I would have bought a better option and for the same price or less.By the way, the problem I mentioned only happens one or two times during 2 hours of playing, it never happens to my ps4 controller (which I also connect to the pc)",neutral
Garbage,1.0,"This is hands down the worst controller I’ve owned for any console. Even more frustrating is that it’s also the most expensive. It randomly disconnects and becomes unresponsive but the light stays on, it’s been doing this since day one. The USB C charging port was nice at first since the cable actually stays in the controller port, but of course it no longer reliably works, just like every other horrendous Xbox one controller I’ve had. Microsoft is a horrible company who continuously cheats consumers. I’m not someone who throws or drops controllers, every single one of these controllers is a piece of junk designed to work for a console generation cycle at best.I decided years ago that my Xbox one is the last Xbox product I’ll ever own, I just really can’t believe the controllers are still the same flimsy garbage but are marked up in price. I never had any of these problems with my 360 controllers that survived many road trips.  I can’t even charge the controller while holding it. Belongs in the trash.",negative
Not worth the $$$,2.0,Drifts really really bad. The buttons down work or register. My 10 year old son got this for his bday and was really disappointed he couldn’t play any of his games with it. Save the time and for the same amount of money just buy a new one at GameStop.,negative
Not worth it,1.0,Ordered this controller May. 23rd and it went bad by June. 23rd. Possibly started having bugs earlier but I was hoping the controller was not the issue. Now after trying all other tech devices I realized that this wireless controller has issues syncing the in game sound when using the audio jack with headphones. Can hear friends in the party chat fine but unless I keep turning the controller off/on and restarting the game the in game sounds wont sync. Return window just closed so I only got good use out of this for less than a month! Disappointing quality for the price!,negative
Low Quality,2.0,"Received the controller earlier today. Wasn't actually secured inside of the box besides resting in a plastic mold, and was covered in a bit of dust I had to clean off. Quite off-putting considering I ordered a 'new' controller, not a refurbished one, like it visually seemed to be. Tried it out for about an hour. Thoroughly disappointed. Low quality plastic casing that's ""textured for grip"" but actually just feels rough and awful to the touch. Think The trigger/bumper buttons sort of pinch my fingers if I switch between them without being careful, though the texture on them seems fine. Better off using one of the walmart controllers honestly, even past their slightly altered shape.I would give this 1 star but it *does* work. No issues pairing it to my pc, works as intended, just an all-around low-quality product to me unfortunately.",negative
Buyer Beware!!! Received a Used and Broken Controller!,1.0,"I ordered a new controller for my son. When this package arrived the Box was not even sealed.

Cheap chinese products that break immediately. Thanks Microsoft,1.0,"Brand new controller has already had 2 buttons stick after less than 2 months of use. These are maybe 1/10th the build quality of old 360 controllers and cost more. I do not mistreat my controllers, adult use only and this has already completely failed. I will not be buying another Xbox in the future and have decided to build a PC. Do better Microsoft. Your planned obsolescence has gone too far and your products are junk.",negative
Bluetooth works WIndows 10 and Steam,5.0,"Bought this controller on launch day.  At first, was only able to get the controller to work in Windows 10 with Steam using a USB-C cable.  I downloaded the Xbox Accessories App from the Windows store and updated the controller firmware.  Then, I fully updated Windows 10, rebooted my laptop, and removed and re-added the controller via Bluetooth.  Bluetooth works fine now in Windows 10 and Steam.  I like the matte finish of the controller.  Also, I like the textured triggers.  Button clicks are a little loud.  Would have been nice to have a USB-C cable included but I have a few cables laying around.  After a little struggle with the setup, I like the feel of this controller.",positive
Damaged packaging and controller,2.0,"The controller and packaging came in damaged, usually the controller is one of the best money can buy, I bought another one for the purpose of playing on my Apple devices and as a second controller for my series S. Unfortunately the package not only arrived late but arrived damaged in a dinky paper bag. The controller is absolutely filthy and covered in dust. This isn’t the only time something like this has happened.",negative
A very good controller for PC gaming but consider skipping it if you already have a gamepad,5.0,"I grabbed this on sale for $40 to upgrade from using Xbox one controllers for PC gaming.  Yes, the D-pad is definitely better with this model!  But, I can totally envision someone being disappointed with buying this if they already use an Xbox One controller for PC gaming.Don't get me wrong: this is a great gaming controller and you will be happy with it if you buy it.  Just don't expect it to be a huge improvement over existing stuff.",positive
Issues with 3.5mm jack,4.0,"I love the feel of this new controller and it seems to work fine on my Xbox One, the only issue I have is with the 3.5mm jack. I have a set of Runmus gaming headphones which do not work with this new controller. I did some research and I think the issue is that some of the after market headphones use 4 pole 3.5mm plugs, and the new core controller has a 3 pole port. I'm ordering a new headset and will update my review when tested.",positive
Don't buy if you don't got a usb c cable,1.0,If you don't have a usb c cable don't bother. I also recommend you get a chargable battery with this as well. I don't recommend you pay extra usb c that comes with this. Overall though controller feels great in my hands alougth the bumper buttons feel a bit stiff and the d pad really ain't great for classic games. Edit:after a month in the bumper can get stuck in at random. Also I forgot to mention in my previous review that the analog stick feels extremely stiff as well. It's clear that this is lacking in quality and not really worth the buy. If your fighting game fan avoid this controller at all costs it's does not feel good at use in any fighting games,negative
Great controller but with cons.  Updated review,2.0,The great form and function of the Xbox controller is already there from previous gen.  What I appreciate now is the new feel you can’t see in a pic. Has a nice textured grip and of course the new D pad.  Works on my Xbox One X as wellUpdate as of 1/15/21.  The A button is starting to stick.  Also the joysticks are starting to discolor after use.  No I do not eat food and get greasy fingers all over my controller when gaming.  Bumping my review down to 2 stars,negative
The 2nd best controller I've ever used,4.0,"The only issue with this is that the damm thing dose not come with a USB-c cable to plug it in to use without battery/bluetooth, other than that is the second most comfortable controller I have used in my 23 years of playing videogames, triggers are awsome and have their own rumble moters along with the standard 2 grip rumblers that you see in almost every other one, but its almost on par with nintendos HD rumble, all microsoft should add is adaptive triggers to make take this thing from great to amazing",positive
Nice improvement over original,5.0,"I needed a second controller for my Xbox One S so I waited for fo this one to come out. I like that it has a very similar look to the original white controller I have, but just enough difference so that I can easily tell which one is my controller (I have it set to auto-log me in when I turn this controller on). The share button wasn't a big deal to me, but I do like the added grip on the back and triggers as well as the upgraded D-pad. BEautiful controller and works great.",positive
This controller does NOT work with the original xbox wireless adapter,3.0,I bought this to replace the xbox one controller I was using on my PC with the xbox wireless adapter (since my gaming PC has no bluetooth option) and this new controller definitely does NOT work with the original xbox wireless adapter. So now I had to purchase a bluetooth adapter for my PC which is an extra cost. No idea why Microsoft decided to not allow the new controllers work with their own adapter.,neutral
Familiar controller with welcome additions,5.0,"I was excited this pick this controller up after already loving the Xbox One controller. Right off the bat, the the textured handles on the back give something nice for your fingers to rest on. The addition of the dedicated share button was welcome since the previous method was awkward and obtuse. The change from a Micro USB to USB C port was also welcome as the previous port felt flimsy and the shift nowadays towards the latter means more available cables at hand hopefully.If you’re old controller is looking a bit beat up  or you were interested in an upgrade, you can’t go wrong with this one.",positive
Doesn't Work Well with PC,1.0,"I really wanted to like this controller. It looks and feels great, but I had constant disconnects and problems with buttons not registering while playing on PC. I originally thought the controller was defective, so I returned it and ordered another, but the replacement had the same issues.If you're looking for a controller for your PC, I'd skip this one and stick with the One S controllers until Microsoft addresses the issues with this controller.",negative
Great controller!,5.0,"I've always loved using XBOX controllers for my PC, they always work flawlessly and quickly in any game.  The blue color is gorgeous and I do like the small changes they've made from last generation, the whole thing feels a bit smaller and lighter but still very well made.  The textured grip is a nice touch too.The one thing to know is that this controller is BLUETOOTH.  If your PC doesn't have it, you'll need to buy a bluetooth dongle to make it work.  I got one from My Tech Key and it has worked wonderfully.",positive
Does NOT work with Windows 10 PC,1.0,"This Microsoft Xbox Wireless Core Controller will NOT pair with my up-to-date, Bluetooth enabled Windows 10 PC. This controller with the extra ""sharing button"" should be avoided if you want to connect this controller to anything but an Xbox. The copy here on Amazon is WRONG. This controller will NOT work with a Windows 10 PC.Back to Amazon it goes. So sad because it is a nice quality build. Note: I have 2 older Microsoft Xbox controllers, one wired and one wireless. They both work flawlessly. I'm not some crazed Microsoft hater. This 3rd sharing button controller DOES NOT WORK with a Windows 10 PC. Avoid if this matches your situation.",negative
Possibly used or returned,1.0,When I got the box it was crushed on the side during shipping (or was it). I got out my flashlight to inspect the controller before putting my hands all over it under the impression it may be used. The confirmation for me was the fact the14 day game pass trial when entered came up as already redeemed. Its possible somebody is taking these codes to resell but breaking into the box to do so.,negative
Great except defective.,4.0,"Well I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it was perfectly fine. HOWEVER it kept turning off and on, disconnecting from the Xbox, and nothing we tried would fix it. As in batteries, restarting the Xbox, reconnecting the controller, etc. It was simply defective. Bummer! But when I tried to return/replace it was super easy to request it. But then my hubby decided he just wanted the refund because it would’ve take 1-2 MONTHS to get the replacement. Yikes. So then it was a little annoying because when I cancelled the replacement I had no way of seeing on my Amazon app if that was true (only said replacement was ordered) and at that point I couldn’t request a refund. So I called customer service and I was surprised! They were quick and helpful and there was very little hold time. They made the process less annoying. I’ll update my comment if there’s any problem with the actual return or refund. I’d recommend this but with caution. I assume mine was a rarity.",positive
Awsome controller but needs an update for pc users,5.0,Love the presentation from unboxing great feel but man does it eat batteries they last about 45 min before it starts having conection issues i dont know if thats norm so ill try different types but i used Energizer the first time anyway ill update if anything changes:::...UPDATE...::: so the controler does not eat batteries it was an update issue if you use this for pc get the xbox accessory app from the Microsoft store and update your controler and that should take care of the droping signal,positive
New model (share button) not plug and play Windows 10,3.0,"It's a fine controller, just like the last model, but this one shows up in the control panel as ""LE"" XINPUT. I assume because the added ""share"" button. On Windows 10 latest version, RetroArch doesn't recognize it (via BigBox), and Lego games are all whacked. Works but keeps adding the second player. I understand steps can be taken to upgrade drivers or firmware, or spend effort remapping buttons in RetroArch, but I don't have the time to fuss with it. I've returned it and found the last model 1703 I've been using, which continues to work great with everything.",neutral
Needs to be known!,2.0,"(Im On Xbox)  So I bought this thinking that it would be a nice controller that would work, and that it did butttt... it had an issue from the moment I turned it on to the time I got rid of it. I had turned it on and it said ""controller needs an update"" and ""plug in USB to update it"" so I looked at the box and there was NO USB, nothing!!! I was stuck with this and didn't feel like buying one. So I hopped into a game and immediately it took me out saying I needed to update it even though it didn't come with a USB. It did this every five minutes and froze me to the point where I just got a new one! Now all the buttons worked and the condition was fine, but you need to buy a separate USB if you want to even be able to use it. Plus it was taking random clips and screenshots when I didn't even do anything. Overall not bad, MISSING FEW PARTS!!",negative
Very short lifespan under average gaming use,2.0,"Bought this January 2021. By July 2021 the left stick has already started failing to produce forward and backward movement in game. I play maybe 12-16 hours a week tops. Already need to buy a new controller. This is Microsoft brand name. It's garbage. Also, you can't reprogram the capture button on Xbox One (not new gen). You actually tap it, it always records. Then you have to go delete everything. It will not save ""push and hold to capture.""",negative
Second one with issues,2.0,"These models being offered at $55.99 are crap.This is my second controller of this model. The first time I pressed A to update the controller after plugging it in,  the A button sticks and it continues to do so 1/5 times. I just opened it.My first controller of this model went about 2 months before the right stick moves up on its own. In every game, I’m looking straight up if I let go of the stick and typing in the Xbox keyboard is nearly impossible.Microsoft has been known to have controllers that have a life expectancy between a few months to a few years, but this is ridiculous. Brand new with issues??? What are they doing?",negative
High-quality replacement for the original version,5.0,"I've been using an XBox 360 controller to play games on my PC for many years now. The one I was using was one of the original Microsoft wired versions, and was fine until it started to show signs of wear and tear. I selected this one to replace it as it proposed a Bluetooth connection in lieu of a wired one. It took a bit of trial and error to get the computer to recognize and install it, but I've had zero problems since then. Very happy with the product. Recommended.",positive
Great would 100 percent recommend,5.0,"I got this for my fiance as his old controller was partly broken. He says he loves this controller, his hands get a little sweaty while playing so he loves the grips on the back of the controller that feel a little like rubber. He says that helps a lot when he's playing, he loves the blue on the controller and how he can hear the buttons make slight soft clicks while he plays. All in all very happy with this purchase.",positive
Solid Controller for Windows 10 PC,5.0,"Upgraded from my old Xbox 360 wired controller I used for years. Same familiar shape with better grip. Buttons are very clicky without a lot of pre-travel. All buttons working and tested through several runs of Hades (videogame).Easily paired with my PC. Didn't need to update any software for both PC and controller. Purchase date for controller was 11/23/20. Comes with two AA batteries.If you play even on a PC, you need a controller. Some games are just easier to play using a controller over mouse and keyboard. Best part of Xbox controllers is that you don't even need to fiddle around with the inputs. Button mapping is detected immediately by games for Windows.Excellent.",positive
"Not perfect, but fine for my purposes",4.0,"This does not have the same smooth feel or heft of a direct-from-Microsoft controller. Also, the buttons are comparatively very clacky. Occasionally games don’t respond to a “keystroke” but we’re talking maybe 4 times in 8 hours of gaming, and never twice in a row.Nothing has been overly problematic overall, and I wish I could give it a 4.5, but what can ya do. I suppose I should leave the star off because while it works great for others, I’m not exactly DOOMing on ultra nightmare mode over here. Between Diablo and Stardew Valley, it doesn’t hurt me, but my crackshot son and his ilk might disagree.",positive
"Customer, disservice.",1.0,"I have had this controller for about a month and a half.  I have only used it for gaming and kept it in a protective case when not in use.  It has started losing its signal and drifting etc.  I replaced batteries, restarted both controller and console. I even did an update on the controller.  Received on May 5.  Started acting buggy 6-21-21.  No help from Amazon because it’s past their return window.",negative
Meh,2.0,"Ordered this because it looks identical to the original xbox 1 controller....but it's not. I have bought several rechargeable battery packs and NONE of them fit this controller. The covers to the battery packs do not fit the holes on the controller.Also, the trigger buttons started sticking within the first month. Have taken it apart and cleaned it but still have this issue.",negative
Even better than the Xbox 1 controller,5.0,"I have not held the PS5 controller, but I can say that this is Microsoft's best controller I've ever held.The triggers and sides of the controller have textured grips that make it really fun to grasp. It is a unique feeling to have the bumps on the side slide across your skin. It helps keep hold of the controller in intense and sweaty moments.You can use it on Xbox 1 too, so if you have an Xbox 1, just buy this controller.",positive
NOT BRAND NEW!!,1.0,I paid the price of a brand new controller. Does this look brand new to you? It is so filthy I went and scrubbed my hands after taking these photos. Suppose to be an all white controller. Yet there's a black battery case. And there is no capture button like it claims there is. When it arrived I didn't even know what it was because it was cramped inside a small ass box wrapped in paper towel! Seriously?! Quit ripping people off,negative
Ugh,3.0,The controller can in just the regular controller box and a shipping label.  The box was completely destroyed. The controller was hanging out of the box. My son decided to go ahead and see of the controller worked because he didnt want to have to wait weeks for a differnt one. Thankfully it did work to his liking. I would have just sent it back due to the condition it had arrives it.,neutral
Blue tooth connection faulty on two separate controllers,1.0,I ordered two of these both of them are messed upThey both have something weird with the Bluetooth connection!!! The black one just always randomly starts blinking while I am playing trying to connect so I can’t move and I die. The white one is the same issue it would randomly just disconnect or act like I was pushing a bunch of buttons when I was only pushing A or B not every button at once! Now it just blinks and never connects at all it’s just barely past the return window super dumb in my opinion these controllers are whack!!!! I’d give no stars if I could,negative
Better 'D' Pad than Original Series - By Far,5.0,The Xbox controller has been my favorite controller for both Xbox and PC for a long time now. I don't have a Series X Xbox yet so I bought this to use with my Xbox One S and PC. The 'D' pad is a noticeable improvement over the original version. It's has a distinct click and easier to hit on diagonal movements. I really like the new core series controllers a lot. These have become my favorite for Xbox and PC.,positive
Good controller - no cable - bad compatability,1.0,"Edit: after 6 months I’m changing my review down further from 3 stars to 1 star. Constant issues with games recognizing the controller. The last straw is the left bumper broke. An official controller breaking after 6 months, not even that frequent of use is unacceptable.Controller comes with batteries, non-rechargeable and no cable.  This controller requires USB-C instead of micro USB, so I had to go out and buy a new cable. Also, Xbox one rechargeable battery packs are not compatible with this controller.  For some reason going from micro-usb to usb-c makes the batteries not charge.I recommend you just buy an xbox one elite controller... everything works with that.",negative
"Worked great for a while, then MS messed it up",2.0,"This worked great for a few months.  However, MS recently pushed an update that causes this to show up and behave as 2 controllers in Windows. This makes it useless unless I unbind all the keybindings for the second controller in every game I use it in.  Apparently MS is aware of this, and the only fix at the time of writing is to pair/update via an XBox console, which I don't have.",negative
Great controller & works on my Xbox One!,5.0,I bought this controller on sale on a whim. I don't have a Series S/X yet but I needed to replace a  damaged controller and this works perfectly with my Xbox One. In fact I can't tell hardly any between this and the Elite controller other than the obvious additional buttons. This is a fantastic controller for the price when I purchased it.,positive
New ones seem to have a very high defect rate.,1.0,"Bought 3 of these controllers 2 white and one black, returning one after another, first one the the left d-pad button stuck repeating over and over making it useless. 2nd one the x button started sticking after three days. The third had the left  bumper go. I finally decided to she'll out a bit more for the original one s controller, that's been working great for a month now. Also the one that came with my xbox one x had lasted 2 years before getting stick drift. So save yourself the hassle and buy the previous controller. It's worth the extra $10.",negative
Awesome,5.0,My son absolutely love this it is one of the nicer updated controllers that he’s had for a while but for the price and a quick delivery of Amazon he was super happy his birthday was three days ago so he’s been looking forward to it I’ve had to return to already so this is the final one well I just found out he can’t actually use the controller he has to have a micro usb to be able to attach the controller to his game this is stupid I don’t get it he should just be able to click the button and connect this one wouldn’t allow him to but I bought that was another $10 annoying,positive
"Save money, buy somewhere else",1.0,"Seriously? This controller is hardly functional and can’t keep a connection while only five feet from the console. I also can’t plug it in because IT USES A WHOLE DIFFERENT CABLE FROM EVERY OTHER WIRED CONTROLLER. I’ve updated the controller several times and it still randomly drops connection. I looked online to see what I could do to solve the problem and it sounds a lot like I have to buy more products to make this one work. Extremely disappointing considering I had to wait a whole week for it to arrive and paid twice as much as I would for a third-party controller that ACTUALLY WORKS!!! Edit March 13, 2021: got a new pc, same issue. I’m a huge fan of Microsoft and this is so disappointing. Why would I ever purchase another remote from them if the ones I have never work? God I’m so sick of billion dollar companies selling me garbage for ridiculous prices. I wish I could give this product zero stars",negative
XBox or PC gamer? Then you know what this is,5.0,"It works for XBox One and XBox Series S/X consoles, as well as support for PC gaming on Windows-based systems (and maybe some others, but I cannot speak to that). It's more responsive than the former XBox One controllers and has a nicer feel overall, in my opinion. It will also pair via bluetooth beautifully with Samsung phones and tablets for mobile gaming and general device control (again, this may be feasible with other manufacturers, buy my mobile experience is relatively focused).",positive
Great controller for PC!,5.0,"Like the title says it's great for pc gaming, I needed a replacement because my old 360 controller died and I was worried about that it wouldn't meet those standards.  Well it certainly met them but before I talk about the positives I have to mention that it is annoying that this controller still uses AA batteries, sure it's not really an issue for me because I play with a wire all the time but it is something to mention for those who want the wireless experience.  Besides that I love the grip and build, it feels nice and the D-pad is such an awesome improvement!!!! They really improved the tactile feel of the D-pad and it makes it more viable for fighting games and shooters where you might need to use the D-pad to use say a score streak or equip something.  All in all this controller is a personal favorite and it is nice that you can use it on the Xbox One.",positive
Controller came with a broken left trigger. Box was beat up.,1.0,"Left trigger still works, but there is no feedback or resist.Also, the Series controller is worse than the One controller. It unpairs often when playing on PC either on Bluetooth or with Dongle. Never had this issue with the One controller.I would have returned it, but I had thrown away the box before I noticed these issues.",negative
Good Deal,5.0,"I got this one because the thumb tip fell off my old one.This one has a textured surface which makes gripping itduring game play a more immersive feeling.  And a bettergrip always helps with game improvement, ever so slightly.Highly recommended for people with sweaty hands, eventhough that's not the case for me, I can see where thistextured surface would help.",positive
Bluetooth functionality is flaky,1.0,"Ever since I got this controller (Oct 2020) the bluetooth disconnects intermittently. It does this on my console, on my nVidia shield, as well as on my PC. I can't play for more than 3-5 minutes without the bluetooth connectivity disconnecting. I have four original xbox controllers and this one - which is the newest of the four - is the only one that gives me connectivity issues. Very disappointing.",negative
Beautiful and perfect!,5.0,Beautiful control and very easy to connect. I used it with my PC and laptop only. Just do not forget to update firmware. It is perfect!,positive
Complete disappointment!,1.0,"I ordered first controller and it was delivered broken. Second controller was good but would not work with COD Mobile when it said it would work. I then broke controller into pieces and took the $63 loss. I do not recommend this controller to anybody or this seller I do not know what’s going on but I am furious and I guess I am out of the money I spent. It is what it is, life goes on.",negative
Great basic controller,4.0,The battery compartment is shaped differently than previous versions so you won't be able to use the same rechargeable packs you will have to order a different set for the newer model.  All in all its a good controller.  It is sensitive to some cell phone signals and they can cause disruption and make your controller glitch. If you want better control I suggest a pro controller.,positive
Quality abysmal - on my fifth,1.0,"The buttons keep breaking - not like I'm hard on a controller or play games that really take advantage...but seriously, these are made like garbage.The USB-A port on the older design was weak, and now the USB-C on the NEW controller has gone bad on two of my new ones.Microsoft? nowhere to be found offshore support.",negative
Best Controller Made,5.0,"I bought this controller for use with my PC. Prior to this I had an XBox One controller, and prior to that I had an XBox 360 controller.The XBox Series X controller blows both of them out of the water. Just everything about the controller is awesome. AND, I was able to use the same rechargeable battery pack and wireless adapter that I used in the XBox One controller.",positive
Bluetooth stopped working,2.0,"I had an elite controller as my main, but when I decided to open my brand new robot white controller, I wasn't able to connect to my android device, ios or laptop (was looking forward to gamepass cloud gaming) they work fine via usb-c connectivity but I just couldn't sync via bluetooth. Real shame because I purchased back in February and my chance of returning was no longer valid.Nice looking controller though. LMAO",negative
Just highly disappointed with this thing,1.0,"I bought this thinking it would be my last controller I'd have to buy for maybe 5 years, right? Well, I am going to have to buy something else.  First, and foremost, I have had just awful connectivity with this thing.  At first, I thought it was my crappy batteries, but no.  I buy new batteries and the thing still needs to be 6 inches from my Bluetooth antenna.  Also, I have decided I will avoid disposable batteries from now on.  Lastly,  my trigger almost immediately began to stick.  I have tried to fix it, but it didn't help.",negative
Connection issues and arrived scratched,1.0,"I don't usually leave reviews but I am disappointed enough to make one for this. The controller has a deep scratch on it right out of the box.Also it kept disconnecting from my PC, which I guess is a common issue. I needed to download the Xbox Accessories app and install a firmware update, which kind of took a while. That was an annoyance but it seems to have solved the connection issues.I live far enough away from the closest UPS store to make returning this quite the hassle, so I'll probably just keep it. I'll end up scratching it at some point anyways. Just annoyed. This 'brand new' controller should not have a scratch.",negative
finally the best xbox controller,5.0,"Yes, I realize that this is not the elite controller, but I also realize that most people will not use that one. This is the controller that most people will have, and with the addition of USB c it is finally perfect. Everyone has felt an xbox controller by this point. It's comfortable, well built, and now it can be connected to a laptop easily. Just buy it if you need a new controller there is no reason to get the old one, especially if you play on windows.",positive
Bluetooth buttons mappings are incorrect for some games with PC,1.0,"Great controller... but when using bluetooth (wired is fine) the button mappings are incorrect with some games. An example of this is Yakuza 0.I did update the firmware, I tried everything. The windows accessory app even says im pressing the correct button, but some games just see the wrong buttons being pushed.This is not only me, this is a huge thing. The only solution is to buy the xbox wireless dongle or play wired.",negative
No lag finally,5.0,Definitely better than the older controllers on Xbox one. I right away noticed less lag when rapidly signing in my son to the account. I used to with the old controllers try to enter the code very fast to get it over with and the controller would lag and it would not work. Now I can log him in super fast and the console received it the first time,positive
Works fine. Share Button unneeded.,5.0,"Have had it for a month now and use it every day. I'm not sure I like the New ""Share"" button and hope I can reassign it to another function. But, the controller is otherwise just fine and I've had no problems with it. I wish they came with more than 90 day warranty as my previous model 1695 controllers wireless stopped working more than 12 inches from console after just 4 months but with a cord works fine just no wireless. So I bought this one so happiness abounds.!!!",positive
Don't trust used controllers,1.0,"Always liked newer Xbox controllers bc they are smooth as butter but beware of used controllers....never had trouble with used things fulfilled/sold by Amazon but this time it was clearly not even inspected....triggers were unresponsive so now I have to pay 20$ more than new controllers go for...this is ridiculous,  now I can't enjoy my weekend thanks amazon",negative
Waste of money,1.0,"This item stopped connecting to my Xbox, one week after the return period expired.  It worked fine for two months.  Why these controllers are so cheap and defective all the time I'll never know.  Shame on Microsoft corporation for contracting with such cheap manufacturers.  My next console will not be an Xbox or Microsoft peice of junk.",negative
"Great controller, recommend to all Xbox one players",5.0,"Well worth the preorder, wanted to figure out if they had fixed the Xbox one controllers weak analogs and stick drift issues among other things, and it did not disappoint, they did upgrade the parts that became faulty on the Xbox one controllers. Highly recommend this controller to all Xbox one players. USB c charging as well. If you cant afford or don’t want to spend the money for an elite or mod controller of some sort, this is what you want. Same price as an Xbox one controller for the next generation controller is well worth it.",positive
Drift,1.0,"Controller started to drift days after  6 months of use. I don’t have a choice to say that I’ll never buy another controller because it was a gift to my son and he is so frustrated that he is not able to his game up with this friends. I do request Microsoft to look into this drifting issue, recall and refund/replace the product. MS Warranty sucks that it is only 6 months and can’t get any help.",negative
Bumper buttons break easily,2.0,"After only 2 months, the upper left bumper button already missing contact. These controllers are being build cheaper and cheaper inside. This is the 3rd controller I've had the same issue with. The internal parts (extended plastic) that connect with the switches break with minimal effort and little use. Very expensive for being junk after only 2 months.",negative
Improvements on Xbox controller,5.0,"I had an older Xbox controller, and the headphone jack stopped working, so I got a new controller. It works great, but I wasn't surprised. I was surprised to find some improvements. Not so slippery, with added texture on the bottom of the grips. Additional texture on the front of the triggers. Plug in the front, now USB-C. And they added a ""share"" button in the center. Small things, but nice.",positive
Worked Right Out of the Box,5.0,"My younger sister and I found the concept of upgrading a controller stupid. Hooking it up to the XboxOne was also a bit of a challenge though that was on me; I don't really use newer consoles that often. Otherwise, I had no issues with this controller (it's been a while since I've used such snappy buttons on a device).",positive
Good for android phones,5.0,"Bought this for my son, we use android phones and have tried other controllers this one works great.",positive
works as it should,5.0,"Everything is fine and if you actually read the write up everything is reveled about this controller.  With that being said I got this as a replacement for my Xbox 1 controller.  There is a slight difference in the two, and that's the charging port.  My original came with micro usb port i believe and the new one comes with a C port.  That's it new cord needed to charge",positive
XBOX Core Controller - Conveniently became paper weight,1.0,"A week after the return window closed, this xbox controller ceased to work. Xbox button will not illuminate and USB connection is not recognized. Checked battery terminals, all good. Multiple different batteries, nothing. Unable to see if its it a firmware issue...as the USB connection doesnt even work. For a $60 controller, sad to see its unreturnable.",negative
Used not brand new,1.0,Buyer beware was supposed to be brand new but came used and box was opened and damaged. Would be nice to receive a brand new box and controller when you pay for it,negative
"Overall good, questionable design for face",5.0,"This controller is great overall as to be expected from Microsoft. Has good texture from the added stippling for grip, nice weight, smoother triggers and the shoulder buttons aren't as clunky anymore. However, I think the design of the last controller for Xbox One was much better with the contours on the controller around the Xbox button. This controller's face is really flat and makes me feel like it was a cost cutting design choice.",positive
Like cheap Controller,3.0,"Unfortunately , this Controller not like before , the Quality not good its feel something not orginal , i don't like it",neutral
Controller is Not New,2.0,I ordered one of these controllers and had to send it back because it was very obvious that it had been used before. The joysticks were worn and they were no longer the normal blue color. I just received the replacement (the one in the photos) and it is also not a new controller. Seems like these controllers are refurbished or slightly used because the joysticks are discolored and the box looks like it has been opened and thrown around multiple times. If these controllers are not new then please don’t advertise them as such. I have wasted 1.5 months waiting to receive a new controller and all I’ve gotten is somewhat used controllers. This has been pretty frustrating so I’ll be returning this product AGAIN and heading to the store to pick up a brand new controller.,negative
I Love This Controller,5.0,"I really like what they have done with the new Xbox Controllers.  I like this so much I prefer it over my Xbox Elite controller, it just fits in my hands so good.  I really like the Shock Blue color too.  If anyone is looking to use Kontrol Freeks and looking to maintain that nice blue consistency the blue Alpha KF's match almost perfectly to the color.",positive
Awesome controller,5.0,Works perfectly with my PC and iPad. Feels better than old controller and performs flawlessly. Love the color and the fact I can still use my rechargeable batteries with it. Excellent button feel all around and the new USB C connector is a welcome upgrade as well. Big improvement over the previous gen controllers!,positive
The perfect controller for PC gamers...,5.0,"The subtle improvements they’ve made to the earlier iteration of this controller are very much welcomed. The buttons on the directional pad are more tactile and clicky. The joysticks have a grippy texture and a more pronounced edge, making it easier to keep your thumbs from slipping. The overall shell of the controller is textured and compared to the older Xbox one controller, feels familiar, but better.TLDR - A familiar shape and feel with subtle improvements. No need to fix what isn’t broken!!",positive
Where's my Series X to use it with?,4.0,"I'm sure this is a great controller, it feels great in my hands and I really enjoy the texture on the back. As far as functionality goes, it is really tough to say when I still don't have the console which I also preordered  from Amazon the week prior to ordering the controller. This has been an immense source of frustation to myself and others. Other retailers have been restocking and selling additional consoles and I still don't have the one I ordered in September. This is shameful.",positive
Don't spend your hard earned money on this piece of plastic.,1.0,Update: DOES NOT STAY CONNECTED TO MY PC. It keeps disconnecting and reconnecting every 10 seconds. Even with the controller update. Defective controllers.............Box came in a beat up box with stickers all over the original box (i blame CLT4 of Amazon) Did not come with charging cable. Did not come with an Xbox rechargeable battery (you need to put in batteries like this is 1997) so why am I paying so much for this piece of plastic? Sure it feels nice in my hand but the buttons are LOUD and clunky. I expected more for $60 like it used to be back in the days but I guess Microsoft is going broke or like to rip their users off.,negative
Don't use this for PC,2.0,"Constantly disconnects and will eventually brick itself and stop working altogether.  It's unfortunate because when it works it's good, but after a while it just stops working altogether. Becomes unrecognizable on any platform. Don't waste your money on this if you plan to use it for PC.",negative
Microsoft finally did it right!,5.0,"Great controller, I think it's just a tad smaller than the previous models which for me personally is great. The triggers have been shortened and they use matt plastic instead of a glossy kind, so when you sweat the worst it can do is get on the controller then you just wipe it off. Bluetooth comes standard so great to hook up to a phone or computer to play games. I would highly recommend this.",positive
Left trigger stick BRAND NEW!,3.0,It’s okay if your original controller wasn’t great this one will be a little better my old sticks would wonder even when centered so I got this one it eliminated that problem but the left trigger sticks if pulled to hard in the heat of the moment which could cause you problems in certain games and I’ve had it for about a month maybe 20hrs of playtime MAX it did it right out the box idk if it’s just poorly made or not broken in yet!,neutral
Not brand new,2.0,"I trusted Amazon. But this is my first get a used item while what I purchased is brand new. The first time I open the box, I notice this is the box is old and full of scratches.  And I have a strong feeling that this is unboxed item because the box is looks wried and the controller itself is full of dust!Although it functioning well so far and I don't want to bother to return it. But it gives me a bad feeling of been cheated.",negative
Great gaming controller!,5.0,"I use this to play on my PC all the time. It’s great for when I just want to sit back and not hug my keyboard.  It does disconnect momentarily occasionally, which is annoying to say the least, but otherwise does a great job and I’m glad I bought it last year. I suped it up a bit with a new shell and grips tho.",positive
Disappointed...,1.0,"I’m truly disappointed that this Xbox remote doesn’t work properly. The first day I tried it, it worked fine. A couple of days later, the remote keeps disconnecting and when it connects the analog drifts like if I’m pressing it. Then the rb got lb buttons when you click then, it does a double click at times. I’ve owned Xbox controllers for over a decade and this is the first time when buying a remote, I’ve been so disappointed at the issues it has. I threw away the box thinking this product is quality and I won’t have any issues.. now I’m honestly hoping they still let me return it...",negative
Best Controller for Steam on Windows 10!,5.0,"Simply put- they just work! Plug in the adapter, pair them and Steam does the rest! I've been searching for a great Steam controller for my Son, and this is the one and only. It works with every game that we own and buy! You won't regret this purchase. Oh, and they are ergonomic and they have a really cool and unique rumble!",positive
This has held up well,5.0,"I broke my foot so my daughter and I have been spending tons of time playing Doom and GTA and broke our prior controller. It has held up all summer. Really, I wouldn't expect anything less from an MS Xbox controller. It has chewed through many batteries but maybe that's just how much we're playing right now.",positive
F-,1.0,"Worst controller made cheap cheap cheap , x button started sticking down after about 40 mins of gameplay hour in the RT starts sticking , controller is super trash",negative
Great Controller especially for the price!,5.0,My son loves this wireless controller. I have bought him many wireless controllers and this one is his favorite he says. The feel of this one is textured on the white backside and the red front side is soft like the rubber silicone phone cases. The price is really great also. If you're looking for a good controller then look no further than this one. Get it!,positive
Garbage without an aftermarket battery & charger !!,1.0,"1st time back with Xbox (Haven't touched Xbox since 6-7 rings of death on 'elites' in 2010) ..after getting a 'New Gen' console... What a disappointment compared to the PS5.-Day 1, NON-STOP Disconnect.. spent half the day looking up solutions on YouTube.-Day 2, STILL... Tried to use on PC... SAME PROBLEMS & Microsoft was NO help-Day 5, finally ran across a YouTube vids saying to try an after market battery and charger.. FINALLY Working !!!",negative
Loves it,4.0,"My son loves his new controller, however … there was a card inside with a code for 14 days of free Xbox something-or-another that was a sweet surprise. He was stoked about it. But when he tried to redeem the code his Xbox told him the code had already been redeemed. Well that killed the whole thing for him. How does that happen?",positive
Stopped working,1.0,"This worked for 6 months and then the joysticks stopped working. Tried the troubleshooting steps on Xbox website, but that did not fox the problem. Since the warranty is only 90 days, I was told I would need to buy a new one. They don’t expect the controllers to last more than 90 days and do not stand behind their product. Buy a cheap knock off. It will probably stop working in 6 months also, but at least it will cost a fraction of the Xbox brand controller.",negative
"Works, hopefully for a decent amount of time.",4.0,Works fine so far but it just seems so lightweight. A lot of money for a hunk of plastic with some circuits inside. I had an elete controller that was a few years old and all the sudden the left bumper button broke. It was pretty infuriating. Paying that much for a controller that doesn't work as long as the xbox 360 ones seemed to.,positive
"Works great, no issues yet.",5.0,"Seems to work great, much better than the old logitek controller I had which was not as compatible with today's games although the controls and switches are just about identical.  Have not used it enough to require battery change yet, so I cannot comment on battery life.I recommend doing the software update when you first get it to make sure its up to date.",positive
Works great on PC,5.0,"If you were a fan of the Xbox one controller, you’ll definitely like it. It looks identical to the Xbox One controller except for the new d-pad, textured grips, textured triggers, and the share button. If you plan on using this controller in wired mode on PC, just know it requires a USB Type C cable instead of the old micro usb cable. Other than that, it works great on PC and I really like the textured grips/triggers.",positive
Trouble With double tapping,2.0,"I treat my controllers like gold and this one has given me trouble the past month.When you're trying to move over in menus, etc, no matter if it's the D pad or the left stick, it double jumps on you and makes it extremely irritating to get on the option you want.I wouldn't buy this model again. Very disappointed.",negative
Not worth it.,1.0,"I bought this on July 27th, it's only August 15th and the controller is malfunctioning. It shuts off randomly during gameplay. I've gone through all the motions to make sure it's updated, to power cycle my Xbox, fresh batteries, even re-paired it to the Xbox and nothing has worked to fix it. This controller is faulty. No reason for it to be broken already - I'm very gentle with my electronics.",negative
Dual Colors - Great Controller,5.0,"I didn't realize this controller was two colors with white on the bottom. It looks cool and was a nice surprise even though I'm probably going to get it really dirty lol. The controller needed an update once it synced up to the xbox x, it took a moment to sync but that might have been me not doing it right. No complaints.",positive
Stick Drift,2.0,"I bought 4 different Xbox One Controllers. We've only had them less than 4 months with low to moderate use and already the left-stick drift is terrible. Even on games with a 50% dead zone, I still end up walking up or down when the stick is centered. The stick seems to snap back to center no problem but the electronics have major trouble recognizing it. One controller is far worse than the others, but they all have the same problem. I tried recalibrating and compressed air but neither made a difference. Wish I'd known about the lawsuit before I purchased. I'm surprised there are so many good ratings. Maybe the reviewers just haven't owned them long enough? Or maybe we got unlucky four times in a row?",negative
Received Used Item!!,2.0,"Nowhere in the product description or the title does it mention it is used. This is a huge disappointment and I feel like I was scammed. Item does appear in good shape other than cosmetic scratches, worn pads, oils on the finish, and a small piece of broken black plastic in the battery compartment.",negative
"Okay, but I Prefer the Xbox One Original Controllers",4.0,This is an okay controller. I prefer the earlier model for tye original xbox one. The differences are that these new ones have a built in grip on the handles and triggers which I am not a fan of. It feels very different than the controllers I'm used to. I use this for PC gaming mostly and occasaional Xbox play. It connects alright and feels solid.,positive
DO NOT get this specific controller.,1.0,"I love Xbox controllers, but this specific model is the biggest steaming pile of garbage I've ever used. It disconnects quite literally every 5-10 minutes during use. Imagine having to change your car tires every 2 minutes. Absolutely horrendous. Will be returning this and getting a standard Xbox One Controller.AVOID AT ALL COSTS",negative
Don’t buy if you use rechargeable batteries,1.0,Xbox changed the charging port to USB-C and changed the clip location for the battery cap rendering all my re-chargeable batteries useless. I get upgrading the charging but why change the battery cap?!,negative
"Series X/S controller, very nice. *Stick drifts 8/1/2021*",5.0,"*Left stick drifts up and down, I'm shocked this controller only lasted 6 months before this issue occurred.This is the newer model for Series X/S, it has stippling on the back and on triggers which help with grip. I like this version better than the original. It also has a dedicated share button, nice. Comes with batteries, too.",positive
CONSTANTLY DISCONNECTS DURING GAMEPLAY,1.0,"Great looking controller, and I loved the texturing on the back. However, after updating the controller firmware it would frequently disconnect from my Xbox one for about 3-5 seconds. It would do this constantly during dialogue, and made playing the game impossible. I returned the first controller and had it replaced, thinking it was a defective product. BOTH controllers had the same issue, and now I have to find a new product. I tried every possible solution, but nothing could keep the controller connected without interruption",negative
Not working correctly,1.0,The controller was working fine up until the close return deadline. Now the controller seems to be deactivated and will not sinc up to my xbox. what a coincidence! NOT. I didnt spend 40+ dollars for just 3 months. The product is extremely misleading dont buy. Unless ur prepared to buy another i would recommend getting one from an actual game store.,negative
Controller is good for the most part,3.0,"Overall the controller is working fine.  The joysticks both seem a little loose (by feel and when playing in game) for what I remember from a new controller, but I have no other controllers to compare them against at the moment.  Other than that it is what you expect, standard Xbox core controller.The only real issue I had was while the delivery package was undamaged, the controller box was utterly destroyed when it arrived, like someone had used it as a soccer ball.  I have yet to see if that may lead to some early issues.",neutral
"The best product for PC, but their is only one downfall.",4.0,"The reason why I got the Xbox controller was so that I can play games on my PC. The controller works fine when using Xbox on Windows, and Genshin Impact but it disconnects one time, which is not a big of a deal. But it disconnects tremendously when playing games on Steam (some games), for example on COD BO2 I can't get past the main menu before it just randomly disconnects. I tried everything that the internet suggested to my best ability. Until one person on Reddit had the same problem until he got the Xbox Adapter and that fixed everything, so I got that and ordered it. Hopefully the adapter will fix everything.I will update/edit this review when the adapter comes and it works fine with it.",positive
Dualshock is just better. And the white back is ugly.,3.0,"If you're on PC, even though this works with more games, the dual-shock just seems better constructed and doesn't make clacking noises. The xbox controller is also made for ginormous sausage fingers, and the white back is ugly.  I'm going to have to wash it regularly so that it doesn't turn yellow, ew.",neutral
Dopesauce,5.0,"I love the updates they’ve made to this from the classic. The texturing is in all the right places, the stouter shoulder buttons make trigger finger less of a issue and the paddle D pad has super tactile and audible response. This is by far the best controller I’ve ever held. It’s got a lot of the features of the 150$ pro controller at half the price.",positive
They've done it again!,5.0,"This thing is amazing! I have an original gen 1 Xbox one and connected right up. Thumbsticks perfect. Buttons Perfect. It will accept the regarchable batteries from old controllers but not the back plate. It also accepted the adapter from the old controller, I don't use it much but it helps to balance the weight from top heavy on these things.",positive
Finally a reasonably priced name brand controller!,5.0,"I LOVE this controller! For its price,  it's fantastic.  My old controller was beginning to drift so I needed a new one.  All of the Microsoft controllers are off the chart expensive.  I'm not an elite player,  so I don't need or want the elite controller,  but I hesitate with off brand stuff that was much cheaper. Found this one that works with my xbox one and will still work with the x when I eventually migrate! The textured grips and trigger buttons really help! So much better than the old smooth one I was replacing.  Also,  love the addition of the screen capture button. I've already recommended it to a couple of friends!",positive
Controller works fine but packing was damaged and definitely opened before.,3.0,I would have added an image but I opened the box in a hurry in the hopes the controller actually worked considering it was so expensive. But the box was definitely opened before and everything was loose in the box. They put tape that makes it look like it was never opened but it's undeniable that it was. Box was all torn up. Thankfully the controller was fine and it came with a free 3 month gold code. However I haven't used that yet so I don't know if it will work considering...the box was opened before. Came with batteries. So nothing wrong other then the fact it was opened before. Probably just a company that sells returned controllers.,neutral
"Cool color, works great",5.0,"This is a great alternative to the drab black controllers we’ve been using for years. Different feeling (bumpy) texture and the joy cons are more indented. One hiccup...even though we’ve configured them twice; we keep getting reconnect controller pop ups messages. Works well with Xbox one, can’t wait to receive the Xbox series x. Happy with purchase.",positive
Nice controller but disappointed,3.0,Very nice. Has a nice grip texture and is ergonomically comfortable. Disappointed that it takes a usb c charging cord and doesn’t even come with one. Like the original Xbox one controller I have is a usb b or whatever. So why not give me a c cable since this controller is a c cord?? For 60 bucks it should come with one.,neutral
Could be better but far from good.,4.0,Xbox controllers are always good feeling in the hand but this one lacks and feels cheap. It works and is a upgrade to the one I was using but random low batteries disconnects and cheap feeling plastic makes me want to buy a older model. If it didnt work and or was a upgrade I would rate this less. The USB type C is a nice option.,positive
"Good, but not compatible with my newly bought battery packs",3.0,"I received my delivery yesterday and used this controller for a few hours.  I'm satisfied with it thus far and I really like the texturing on the body and triggers.  I am only using it on the xbox one s so I cant speak to anything related to pc compatibility but it works just as it should for me. The only problem I have is that I also bought rechargeable battery packs and I found out the hard way that,  for whatever reason, the slots that the battery cover slide into are lined up differently from standard controllers to this one.  It makes absolutely no sense to me  and renders my other purchase effectively useless.  I didn't see anything in the description mentioning this and am very disappointed and it put a bad taste in my mouth. Other than that it seems like a good controller.",neutral
"Item perfect, shipping method-not so much!",4.0,"The item was great, but came in an envelope rather than a box and it was crushed. Luckily, the item was ok, but I would be careful ordering from them again because of the poor shipping methods. This was a Christmas gift and it was a little embarrassing giving a gift in a crushed box and saying, ""let me know if it needs to be returned.""",positive
I may never buy an Xbox controller again.,1.0,This is my 4th controller. 1st one the one that came with my console had stick drift. The 2nd one my elite series 2 had stick drift. 3rd one had an issue with the joystick 4th one the one that i am reviewing about. It randomly spammed the A button. Please fix this xbox.,negative
"It's great, but a bit overpriced",4.0,"Nothing special really, though I do really like it. Connects to an Xbox wireless hub if have one and bluetooth if you don't. It's not too hard to switch back and forth, though I wish it was automatic. Range is okay. D-pad is okay. Slight improvement over the xbox one controller.",positive
Sniping Fools like its nothing!,5.0,Went from 0.5 KD to becoming an absolute god-like entity in Warzone thanks to the divine contours of this controller and it's magnificent togglesticks. Shroud will WISH he was you as you snap shot 360 quick scope all your enemies with absolute ease! Contact your doctor if your erection lasts more than 4 hours.,positive
Short lived controller,2.0,"I bought this one in January of 2021 and by September it was a paper weight. It worked great while it lasted. Mine after a few months took a bit longer to power on and the power button would stick. Then finally it wouldn't even power on. Even with full new batteries. And on top of it Microsoft only gives a 7 month warranty and turns out at the time of purchase, it was already 2 months in to the warranty. So now I can't to anything but use it for parts. Buy an extended warranty if you decide to purchase one of these controllers.",negative
It worked fine until I tried the charging port.,2.0,It came broken at the charging port. As someone who doesn’t use many batteries and relies on a charging port it basically rendered it unusable for me after using the batteries it came with. It looks great didn’t look tampered with just maybe a factory defect. I tried contacting but it had been over a month and I tend to forget about things.,negative
right trigger is way too strong but i'm still happy-ish,3.0,"this controller actually feels really nice! i'm really glad i went with it over a 3rd party controller. the calibration out of the box was reasonable, but i was able to correct that easily with my pc. the only issue i'm having with it is that the right trigger feels way too strong. it's not sticking in any way, it almost feels as if there were an additional spring in it compared to the left trigger. i'm sure it's just a fluke, but annoying nontheless.",neutral
Connection issues with windows,2.0,"It constantly disconnects from my pc when I'm gaming. The Bluetooth connection is strong, but for some reason, it continues to disconnect and cause issues when I'm playing. Not very thrilled with this controller, which is really sad because I love the color and shape of it.",negative
Doesn’t work with COD Mobile,5.0,"Looks great, feels great but it will currently not work with COD Mobile. Tried it in IPhone 11 and IPhone 8. Controller connects through bluetooth to the phone but it will not connect to COD Mobile for what ever reason",positive
Faulty Triggers,2.0,"Be aware, the new Xbox Core Controller (every type) has a severe issue with triggers sticking, especially after a good amount of use. This makes games with precision trigger action absolutely impossible. Ridiculous problem to have on such an expensive controller. I've now owned two from two different stores and returned both of them.",negative
Wish I had read reviews first. But no regrets!,4.0,"I love the color. But it will not allow me to use the charge pack that came with the charging station I have. Looks like it was purposefully made so. I found a rechargeable battery pack from another controller that fits, so I can plug it in and charge it. Just wish I had known it wasn't compatible before I dropped the money. THAT BEING SAID, it is an incredible color and it feels great! I love all the features as well! NO REGRETS!",positive
Great design! One down fall.,5.0,Beautiful design! Fully functional. Does require a update when before use. No need for a usb cable. Sync the control to your console. It should pop up a message that says update required. Click continue. It only took mine 5min or less depending on wifi. Grips on the back and triggers allowing for more comfortable feel in your hand. The Only thing I found annoying is the way the D-pad is designed. It's somewhat shaped like a cereal bowl. Meaning the edges are high and the the center is lower somewhat inside the controller. Over all good controller. Share button and headphone jack is convenient. Even came with batteries and 14 days of xbox game pass ultimate!!,positive
Changed my review,1.0,I use this for the newest style of Xbox One.. it worked great for one month and then it will not connect to my console so matter what I do. What a waste of money. So disappointed because I don't have this kind of money to just be throwing away. Be careful Xbox one users.,negative
Microsoft changed the battery lid notches. Rechargeable battery cover no longer fits!,1.0,I bought this Xbox controller and the Rechargeable battery cover doesn’t fit because Microsoft changed the lid notches on this controller! So now I have to take the battery cover off whenever I want to charge it. The battery cover is  just begging to get lost this way.,negative
Broken in 3 months.,1.0,"Well bought this at the beginning of December and today the buttons stopped working.  3 months and broken, wow. Tried changing batteries and repairing with my Xbox One but nothing. Glad I didn't trash my original controller.I did prefer the new style controller, but horrible quality from Microsoft.",negative
Great Controllers,5.0,This Microsoft controller is great for PC gaming or any version of the xbox one and xbox one X/S consoles.  It is lightweight and comfortable to hold.  I also use this controller for gaming on my mobile phone with Gamepass and even playing games in the Tesla Arcade.,positive
Great Xbox X Controller for PC Windows 10,5.0,"I don’t have a Xbox X but use it for my PC desktop Windows 10. Works like a charm. Can be use via wired or Bluetooth. Found it with no problem as a wireless device, even shows the battery life in your Bluetooth listed. Will even list it as a Xbox controller. Works great for Steam games.",positive
"Great, think its changed for new xbox",4.0,"Love the feel, think its made for new xbox because its a type C plug in and the rechargable battery packs covers i bought dont fit, but the battery does so it works",positive
Solid Controller,5.0,"The new Xbox robot white controller provides a solid build quality and comes to reflect what you expect from an upgraded controller. It comes with the 8-way d-pad normally found on the elite series and has a textured surface that provides additional grip when holding it in your hand. Ergonomically it's slightly different than previous controllers, but actually feels better in your hands. There's been no joy con drift, and only a couple of Bluetooth drops that preceded a firmware update that seems to fix the problem. If you're looking for an Xbox controller this is the one.",positive
"Worth the money, lovely controller and awesome for gaming.",5.0,"Great for shooter games, it helps control recoil from guns in games, the texture helps soooooooo much, definitely worth the money and great quality too, I bought this for my Xbox one X and it wasn’t connecting at first but it’s because I had to connect it to the cable it comes with to the Xbox so your Xbox recognize it and updates it, don’t give scared if it doesn’t pair at first. But overall the controller is very good, it’s original from Xbox and it’s worth the money.",positive
"Great controller, Less great build quality",4.0,"Really nice controller, even if the new additions are really small they're very much appreciated. Much more ergonomic than the Xbox One and especially 360 controller.That being said after a few months of daily use I noticed one of the buttons have gotten very mushy and the right bumper is less responsive. A little disappointing to see given everything else about the controller feels much sturdier and higher quality, and that my several Xbox One controllers after years of heavy use have yet to show any wear to this extent.",positive
"Size is great, but textured grip and the sticks aren't",2.0,"I love the new size of this controller and the Bluetooth compatibility with Windows 10 worked great. However, the textured grip is aggressive and off-putting, the sticks feel cheap and like I'm rubbing the plastic off the controller when using them, and the rumble feedback sounds/feels like a massive, cheap step backwards. I can now see why everyone has been saying they prefer the new PS5 controller over this cheap-feeling thing.For a controller I had been waiting to get my hands on, I am massively disappointed. Guess I'll just keep using my Xbox One controller.",negative
💩💩💩💩💩💩,1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS CONTRILLER!  I bought one and it lasted a very short time. I then got a replacement. It too lasted a very short time. I can no longer return this one for a replacement. This a garbage. My controller from when the dang Xbox one first came out still works like a champ.,negative
Worst customer service,1.0,"This item was delayed without being notified. Customer service representatives were so rude and not accommodating. When I told them i wanted them to forward my feedback they said they will consider forwarding it and there is nothing to do about it. Nobody said ""we're sorry"" or ""we'll make sure there won't be any delays"" or ""we'll keep you better updated""",negative
"Good, just note.",5.0,"It’s a very nice controller. The texture makes the controller have more grip and makes it feel good in your hands. Although, if you have a controller gear charging station, it is best to know that the Xbox series x controllers will not fit well with the older controller gear charging stations, if you use controller gear be sure to get the charging station for Xbox series X|S, so that it will work. I’ve tried using a older one and the locks were different for the battery so yeah.",positive
Series x controller,5.0,This is exactly like the controller that came with my Series x. It updated the same way and plays identical. I don't know why they don't sell these controllers as made for the Series x... but anyway. Just wish I would have bought a different color so I could tell it apart.,positive
Left thumb stick drift in record time,1.0,"After 3 months of occasional use, the left thumb stick is already drifting. Bought this one as a replacement for the exact same issue on a 6 month old controller. These things are expensive - I can't stick with xbox if controllers are being used up like water.",negative
used.,1.0,"bought this new, and it was clearly used. the packing bag it came in was sealed perfectly, but the box that the controller was in was completely damaged. so it was clearly packed this way. when i took it out, i instantly noticed that the a button was sticking.",negative
What is this.,1.0,I bought a Used Controller from Amazon themselves and when I opened it up there was this controller in it. At first I was like sure it's a better looking controller but then I wanted to switch it for an actual series x controller and they said they couldn't do that and it was just a $30 refund or a $8.08 promo to keep it so I took the promo thinking a controller is better than no controller then I took the controller out of the box it's heavily used the thumb sticks are literally worn down and paint is coming off too.,negative
Great gift for PC Gamers,5.0,"I got this controller for my dad despite being a Sony kind of guy and he absolutely loved it. It had a grainy texture, nice button input, and the best D-pad I ever seen. He liked it so much I even got one for myself and I could see why he enjoyed it lol.",positive
Easy on the Eyes but not the Ears,4.0,"The ""Pulse Red"" variant is gorgeous but the D-pad is still annoyingly loud; sound dampeners desperately needed. This was a replacement for the Robot White controller which started experiencing left stick drift in 5 months. Hopefully this was fares better and if not, I'll be changing my review to reflect that.",positive
Terrible,1.0,Controller constantly disconnects while in game. Spent money on a worthless product,negative
This thing is strong!!,5.0,"I bought this controller due to my very bad anger problems. The last controller was broken over my dogs head and now this one was broken over my wife’s!!!!! However this controller broke in 3 hits instead of 2!!! Very durable !! Also, don’t drink PBR around your family!!!",positive
Just beautiful,5.0,Love it.,positive

Much more than I thought.,5.0,"Immediately, I noticed the quality difference from the older Xbox one controllers. For the price, this controller is out of the box, better to not only look at... but to hold. I will recommend this controller to anyone who needs one.",positive
Very solid feeling,5.0,"This is a very solid feeling controller. I replaced my old xbox one controllers with a couple of these and they just feel so much better made. The plastic is solid, there's a good weight to it, and the buttons have a sort of click when you press them that lets you know you didn't miss a press.",positive
Love the color,5.0,The color is awesome and looks fantastic on my pegboardIt works just as responsive as the Xbox controller that came with my Xbox Series S.Two AA batteries included but I use rechargeable ones to be more environmental friendly!,positive
Poor results. Fast drop in quality,2.0,"7 days after the return window closed the button the left trigger presses on came loose and the glue that was holding it on now causes the trigger to stick down. Since I couldn’t fix it I tried cleaning it.  It’s just not working well. I used it a few weeks, 65 bucks ....",negative
This controller is awesome.,5.0,This controller is AWESOME. At least that’s what the kids say. Works great too. The color is beautiful.Edit: Do u make it a habit to sell Xbox pass codes that have already been used because I’ve noticed I’m not the only one who encountered this issue. SMH.,positive
Looks sick!!!,5.0,"Decided to get myself another Series line controller because the new design rules. Went with the aqua and am so glad I did. Got good quality, matching blue thumb grips for the controller and I'm in comfort gaming bliss. My new favorite controller.",positive
You will love it!,5.0,"Feels great in hand, love the textured grips, for my hands it is a few centimeters small then previous xbox controllers which is hardly noticeable***will update after game use for  maneuverability and gaming feel",positive
"It worked, but not anymore. Don't waste your money",2.0,"It was perfect when it came, it connected to the Xbox fine and functioned normally. Now it randomly disconnected from the Xbox and won't connect. This is why PlayStation is elite, you buy a controller for $60 and it requires AA batteries but get a PlayStation controller for $60, you get a rechargable battery. Do not recommend this controller. Might as well as buy a cheap wired one because it would actually work. Waste of $60",negative
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,1.0,"WARNING----- Possible scam. Not a unpacked brand new item.Purchased this controller not only because of the skin, but because it was supposed to have an ultimate game  pass subscription gift.To my surprise this was already redeemed. It seems this is a re-package or refurbished product.",negative
As expected,5.0,"Just a refresh of the Xbox One S controller really. Feels a little more comfortable and easier to wrap my hands around, buttons seem more pronounced. The tac grip is a nice touch especially on the triggers. I'll keep using my Elite 2 but no guests will complain when I hand this one to them. Used with Windows 10/Android.",positive
Will not sync,3.0,"Tried to set up this controller for one of my kids before leaving town for a week, and after 3 attempts to sync it to my Xbox One I gave up. I will try one more time upon returning home before returning the controller.Update:After considerable troubleshooting it did finally sync.",neutral
Yes! Thisnis the new Xbox Series (S)(X) controller & uses USB C cables,5.0,"1st off yes this is the new Series (S)(X) controller. I do not think it tells you in the description that these new Xbox Series controllers now use USB C instead of USB mini. W/ the adapter battery pack installed it weighs the same as the Xbox One controller when it is empty & has no battery installed. It is just a little bit lighter, but not Playstation light. I appreciate the texture that has just enough to make site you do not lose your grip on it. Other that these things it is simply a Xbox One controller, but more modern.",positive
Good controller,5.0,"It's nice it paired with the Bluetooth dongle I ordered with it no problem. It feels nice to play with, smooth trigger action, good stick and button feel.If you're using it for FFXIV, use it wired because it has mad stick drift. It's the only program I've run across with this problem and it seems to be software related to the new controllers. I'm trying a Microsoft brand dongle next to see if the drift stops.",positive
Shimmy Shimmy Coco Puff,5.0,It sure is purdy... Also the slight tweaks made to the next generations controllers are welcome changes.,positive
"No Durability, Terrible Value",1.0,"This is now the 3rd controller in the last 18 months I’ve had to buy and I rarely play video games. Bottom line is that they have no durability, they’re prone to failure, and Microsoft will not stand behind their product. Amazon support told me that my controller was still under manufacturer warranty (I bought it less than 4 months ago). I called Microsoft and they told me warranty only lasts 90 days. They refused to stand behind their product and said I would just have to pony up money for my 4th controller in 18 months. What a joke",negative
Drifting after 9 months,1.0,I have had this controller for 9 months. I only use it occasionally on my pc as i usually play on my ps5. It has developed such bad drift it is basically unusable.My old xbox 360 controller from 2014 still works just fine.These new controllers are garbage - would not recommend,negative
Controller lives up to reviews and feedback on Amazon,5.0,This controller is amazing!  It looks and operates as promised working flawlessly with my Xbox One.  It’s also easy to use with my controller charger and there have been no issues with using it to replace the broken controller that came with my Xbox.  I will definitely be using this company/vendor again in the future.,positive
Best for gamers!,5.0,I use this controller everyday and it has allowed me to catch for dubs in Call of Duty than any controller on the market. Would highly recommend if you are in the market for winning constantly and being able to tell your friends you're cooler than them. Great product!,positive
I bought shock blue and aqua shift and they both have different backs,1.0,The back is designed different for two controllers from the same place. I will be returning the most recent controller since I already bought a new charging station for the last controller I bought. I thought I was getting a controller that would work the the brand new Xbox controllers. I have no idea why this would keep changing as I now have three controllers (two purchased new within the last month) that have different backs for the batteries. Unless you plan on using AA batteries don’t buy this controller!,negative
Looks awesome/horrible durability,2.0,"I purchased this controller on April 7 2021it started giving me problems about two weeks ago and now the controller is nearly unplayable. The left analog stick gets stuck inwards,majority of the time. This then causes the player/sports team/whatever game you were playing to move on that soon. I am 25 years old oh and enjoy the video games very much. I most games are play or indie games and action role-playing furthermore the controller has never touched anyone else’s hands besides for my own and the soft table I gently laid on when I am finished. I am very disappointed",negative
Don’t buy rechargeable battery packs won’t work,1.0,Looks like I should have read reviews on this more closely. Thought the rechargeable battery pack that has fit all my other controllers would work. Nope.  Had an brand new extra set of rechargeable battery packs. Also no. Lame!!  Looks specifically designed not to fit.,negative
What to know before buying,5.0,The controller is very solid and has a beautiful level of accuracy in reading my inputs with precision with excellent feel.  However the controller would be a 5 star but two things hold it back:1: randomly disconnects on Bluetooth for pc2: pressing r3 causes the controller to input a second controller in games that allow it until the controller's drivers get updatedEdit: these are easily fixed by connecting the controller with a USB type C and updating the controllers on the Xbox accessories app,positive
Busted sync button,2.0,"Controller works fine, but it's always fun to take a brand new product out of the box and go to sync it so you can actually use it and it doesn't work. Pushing the sync button does not start the sync process. It took 30 minutes to get it to work, and I have no idea how because it DOES NOT work anymore. I've had to try and re-sync do to fixing errors and it just does not work when you press it. So this was an extreme waste of money as it decided to just shut off sometimes and it takes an age to get it to function again bypassing the sync function",negative
Sucks,1.0,Sure it looks cool. Can't stay connected to the pc. Mid game your stuck waiting for it to reconnect every 5m,negative
Is this fake or is microsoft slipping?,1.0,"I bought this controller in November 2020. At first I thought the controller was fine, as I was having no issues. a few hours of play into the controller and it was cutting out on me mid game. I figured brand new batteries aught to fix the problem. nope... the controller is a piece of garbage. along with the Microsoft adapter I got for my PC last month, between the two it makes the game almost unenjoyable. If you want hours of frustration around every corner and want to spend an absurd amount of money to do so... this is the controller for you!!! otherwise Id highlyl recommend any POS chinese knockoff over this garbage...",negative
I like the blue!,5.0,"Got the controller that comes with my xbox series x, carbon black... I am very “heavy handed” with my controllers. I bought the Robot white too, got to get them all! I like how I can switch from one controller to the next! These controllers are awesome!",positive
Garbage,1.0,"Have owned this controller for 6 months , and it’s already quit working. I only use my Xbox One about once every week and almost exclusively for watching apps.Whenever I try to use this controller, it blinks a few times and vibrates, but then it turns off.I’ve called Amazon and Microsoft Support, but they’ve both said it’s outside of the warranty. It’s ridiculous that I am now going to have to buy a new controller a few months later.Very disappointed with Amazon and Microsoft Support.",negative
Screenshot button is a bit funky,4.0,"Overall just a good basic controller. However, I have found that after changing the mapping of the ""screenshot"" button to record when pressed (rather than having to hold it down to record) it still is taking screenshots, not recording. A slight inconvenience but the controller does its job.",positive
Connection troubles,3.0,"The design is sleek and smaller than the older models. However, it sucks at staying connected. Randomly while playing the controller will disconnect for no reason whatsoever. Nothing blocking or interfering with it which is unfortunate because it's rather expensive lol",neutral
It’s alright hopefully,3.0,My son ordered this controller. He has 1 already. It’s ok not too bad but he preferred another cuz sometimes it’s a hit & miss but my son is a rugged player. Also when it was delivered the box was creased Hopefully this doesn’t affect the controller. I hope the delivery driver didn’t throw it on ground.,neutral
Great Color!,5.0,The picture of the product doesn't do it justice. You need to have this controller in your hands to appreciate the color scheme and nice grips. Of course it will need a firmware update on your Xbox Series X/S. Worth the money.,positive
"Works on PC, makes games more fun!",5.0,"This controller is well made and has a nice feel.  It works wirelessly on my PC via Steam or DS4Windows.  Aiming weapons is a lot more precise, which makes games easier to play and more fun.  Highly recommended, for now.  Let's see how ling it lasts.",positive
The controller works!,4.0,"I was happy to have gotten this controller. It was a reasonable price and I enjoy having it. Sometimes it de syncs from my first gen Xbox One, however I don’t know if that’s a problem with the Xbox or if it is a problem with the software on the controller. Otherwise, it was exactly what I expected.",positive
Feels Cheap; Improved Battery Compartment,4.0,"I purchased the Xbox One controller to upgrade from an Xbox 360 controller that was showing its age.  I, like many others, also learned that I needed the new Bluetooth dongle to connect it to my PC.Compared to the Xbox 360 controller, the Xbox One controller feels cheaply made, with the sticks offering less resistance, the buttons 'clicking' loudly, and the triggers having softer springs.It functions fine though, and I use it for casual gaming, so I originally planned on 3 stars.  I gave it the 4th star because the battery compartment is a great improvement over the design on the Xbox 360 controller.",positive
Didnt work.torn box!!!.,1.0,So i order this march 25th got it in a descent amount of time but the box looked torn apart and them taped back together. Im not sure if i accidentally bought a used one but i didnt want to anyway. I then placed it on a shelf till now may 13th and it doesnt work the right trigger button. I should have checked it right away cuz now i cant get my money back on it or at least a refurn and a new controller,negative
I'm not allowed to use it.,5.0,So I guess I messed up the other controller because the A button sticks so I bought this one to replace it. My boyfriend loves it and I'm not allowed to touch it. So from him it's great but I can't really give my opinion because like I said I can't touch it. I get the crappy one now. Might have to buy one more!!,positive
Have a C Cable,3.0,"If your buying this controller make sure you have a C cable already, or add a random C cable to ur cart. Right when u get the controller connected it’ll require a update and you need to connect it to ur Xbox with a c cable to update the controller. And if you don’t update it the controller stops workign every like 10 mins, I just had to order a c cable after already getting the controller. You would think they would include something that was required to use the controller.",neutral
Two words: Decently Updated,4.0,"It’s a nice controller, plain and simple. Love the texture grip, feeing the tri-tone color palette, and the dpad is quite interestingly functional. The new pairing and sharing buttons are useful and USB-C is a welcomed change.Only downside is no included USB-C cable and for the price paid, you would think it would be included.",positive
Another home run from MSFT,5.0,"Xbox controllers are the best in the business. Works great on all our Xbox's (X1,X1X, xCloud & XSX). Very comfortable for long gaming sessions and the rumble is subtle so no need to turn off in fps games. The updated ergonomics and texture added to the new controller are fantastic.",positive
"Product was NOT anywhere near ""New""!",1.0,"Would give ZERO stars if I could. Received product a full week or more EARLY, wow GREAT right? WRONG! Opened the Amazon box (Which was clearly reused) and when I seen the controller box I immediately started a refund ticket. These people sent me a product where the box was crushed, tapped in multiple spots and basically destroyed, even the bubble wrap was deflated. I didn't even bother to open it, how disgusting to say this was "" New"". I printed label, sent it back and they received it within days. I am still waiting for my refund to this day.... Also, they say they can charge up to 50% for a ""Restock Fee""..... do NOT buy from this seller!",negative
"So far, so good but we’ll see",5.0,"Good solid construction from what I can tell so far. The reason I bought this was becuz of the drifting problem of my old one. Overall, I’m dissapointed at MSFT for not making these controllers good in the enough in the past, but we’ll see.",positive
Awesome controller!!,5.0,"This is a great controller! So much better than the original Xbox one controllers, and they work together on the same adapter. Now my girlfriend is going to get one. Great purchase and upgrade. Lighter but feels better, responsiveness is top notch. I will be getting another one.",positive
Not worth the price unless on sale,3.0,"These need to be cheaper. They are $60 which is 1/4 of the Xbox one value. Get it together Microsoft. I am happy with my purchase because the controller is amazing as always but the prices keep going up and it gets old fast. If you have the courage, buy an off brand, power to you. However, if you have the money to throw you will not be let down.",neutral
Beautiful and comfortable,5.0,"Beautiful and comfortable wireless Xbox controller. Definitely does not drain the batteries as much as the older ones. I noticed when the batteries get close to dying, the controller automatically turns off vibrations to save battery life!",positive
Great product,1.0,This controller is great product and works just fine the problem is before I ordered it  it said it would be delivered before Christmas and immediately after I placed the order it said it wouldn't get here until after Christmas and it was supposed to be a Christmas gift,negative
Great Controller,5.0,These are great but they don’t use anything but AA batteries meanwhile any other controller you by that’s not Microsoft is going to come with none functioning buttons kind of like the venom controller I got that had the most excellent mod. Completely unreliable,positive
Can’t attach headphones because it doesn’t work when you do,1.0,Do NOT BUY USED!! I attached my headphones and they don’t work! Which makes the controller useless!! I’m so upset for trying to buy used! BUY NEW IF YA GET IT AND BEWARE BECAUSE THE AUDIO JACK OBVIOUSLY STOPS WORKING.,negative
"Feels great,  i love it",5.0,This controller feels great there's a dotted grip allover it and its smaller than the old 360 controller its windows ready and just feels nice in the hands!One thing to ad tho it was a few days late in shipping but things happen.,positive
Fantastic Controller for PC Gaming,5.0,"It fits well in my small hands and is very comfortable to use. The triggers feel amazing, the sticks nice and accurate, the D-Pad is fantastic. Simply, I can't say enough good about this controller. Just make sure to have some AA batteries if you want to use it wirelessly, but if you sit close to your PC and don't mind a wire, you can plug it in with USB-C and it'll work like a dream.",positive
Battery compartment hard to access,3.0,"I bought this as a replacement for my aging Xbox One wireless controller.  It seems well-made and performs just fine.  However, the battery compartment is surprisingly hard to open - harder than any Xbox controller I have ever used, and I have used at least four different Xbox One wireless controller models.  I like to use rechargeable batteries but this one is a pain - makes me long for the old Xbox 360 button access style.",neutral
Bueno,5.0,"Funciona muy bien, no trae cable pero el de los celulares nuevos le funciona muy bien",positive
one of these isn't like the other,3.0,"It works, but after purchasing rechargeable batteries and a charging stand I was disappointed that the battery packs for the x box one s controllers do not fit this controller so I'm reduced to one controller with  a rechargeable battery and this one.....with AA batteries.",neutral
Very dissatisfied,1.0,When I got this control something was rattling inside which made suspicious. Should of listened to my instincts and returned it. It only got worse from there the controller would get stuck and it would glitch and push A automatically. I would have to tap it for it to get unstuck. (Which mind you should not happen to any new product) anyways not only 3 months later it broke all the way. Nothing works I tried switching batteries because I thought it ran out of battery but it turns out the controller just doesn’t work anymore. It didn’t even last me a year. Do not buy not worth it.,negative
Always Buy OEM,4.0,"Bought this controller for my PC and it confirms my belief, always buy OEM (if you can). Sure the price is steep and it lacks the flare that 3rd party offers but, if we're being honest, Microsoft brand controllers have always been the most reliable. No mushy buttons, decent textures, and works on PC right out the box. The color variant I got is a little too neon but I'm usually looking at my game not the controller anyways so it's a non issue.",positive
Stunning Controller!,5.0,This is such a beautiful controller! The blue just looks awesome in person. It feels great in the hand (especially with the grippy texture on the back). It works great with my xbox one s. It looks pretty high quality and I haven't had any issues with it yet.,positive
It’s red,5.0,My series x controller right trigger started sticking. So I ordered this because I need a controller. I sent the other one back to be fixed. And got the red one as it will be different from my kids Xbox series s/x controllers,positive
Garbage,1.0,Feels like a cheap third party rip off. Took 2 weeks to deliver and no backwards compatible rechargeable batteries,negative
Nice,4.0,"Honestly haven't used it too much yet. Bought it as a Christmas present for my boyfriend but of course he stopped playing soon after. Held up for when he did play, and he said it felt nicer in his hands than any other controller.",positive
Too LOUD!,3.0,"I like the original Xbox one and 360 controllers a lot, but this new gen one is far too clicky and loud. My sister can tell I'm gaming from 100ft away from her room with the doors closed. It's definitely the loudest controller I've ever owned.",neutral
DOES NOT WORK FOR XBOX ONE,1.0,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH REGULAR XBOX ONE. It claims it is but now I wish I had looked into this garbage product a little before purchasing. If you attempt to do so then you will be met with a disconnect error every 30seconds or so leaving you on hold with xbox tech support for hours to no avail. Just buy a regular xbox one controller and don't get scammed the way I did,negative
Good when it stays connected.,4.0,Works like it should when it stays connected. Textured back and triggers is a cool change. I am using it to play on pc over bluetooth but have consistent disconnects. The firmware is version 5.5.2641.0 using the xbox accessories app but still have issues. Not sure if its a steam problem or bluetooth issue. I used the og xbox one controller with the usb adaptor and never had connection issues. Hopefully another update fixes it.,positive
Nice Controller,5.0,"The gamers in my household are loving this controller.  The red is more matte than shiny, but I think I like that better than the shiny red one (wired) that we already owned.  So far, no quality issues or glitches.  Happy with this purchase!",positive
Defective. Randomly disconnects when using headphones.,1.0,"If you just this controller with headphones plugged in, expect it to work fine for about 5 minutes, and then suddenly stop. Fresh batteries. Light still on, still says it's connected. But all the buttons and joysticks still stop working. The only solution is to turn it off and back on, or don't use headphones.",negative
Never again,1.0,"Chose 2 day shipping and it comes in 1 day like yeah that was cool...but open the box, power it up, update the firmware, start using it and every 1-2 mins it says reconnect controller a quick few secs and then connects again. Restart console...change batteries...check for updates...nope it's a brand new faulty controller apparently. Never ordering one online again. You're better off going to walmart\target\best buy\ect.",negative
Quality controller.,4.0,Solid controller. Only thing I noticed is the paint comes off waayyy to easy. Scuffs easily. Nice beefy grip texture around the handle and triggers.,positive
After about 3 months it got the drift issue.,1.0,"This controller was fine for about 3 months of pretty light use, then the terrible drift started out of nowhere. It appears to be a fairly common issue with the series controller. There was even a lawsuit about it. So it seems I'm stuck with a controller that constantly moves forward. Guess I'm just lucky like that. So beware.",negative
Why do my Xbox controllers keep breaking?,1.0,"I am regular xbox player, I play 3 or 4 times a week. I take care of my controllers. However, problems on the RB and LB buttons are constant. They always break one way or another. They seem to have some sort of design issue. I don't think dropping them or pressing them too hard would make them break in the way they do. I only used this one for exactly 4 months... It's a shame...",negative
it keeps saying reconnect controller,3.0,the controller worked great at first but with my Xbox One every few minutes it tells me to reconnect the controller and i simply exit and its fine again for another few minutes. i have not found any reason as to why this is doing this? maybe its my Xbox and it being the 1st gen of Xbox One?,neutral
Connectivity issues on Xbox One,4.0,The connection is bad between the controller and a standard model Xbox One. I had bought it with the knowledge I would be switching over soon anyways. It disconnects sporadically and has a hard time on first startup. Other than that the controller is fine and works as expected.,positive
Good controller but disconnects,2.0,"Overall it is a great controller, however it seemingly randomly seems to disconnect while using it.  After a few seconds it reconnects but obviously an issue with game play.",negative
Broken terrible product,1.0,"Seems like a knockoff, broken product. Came in an official Xbox box, it lights up, but tried everything and couldn’t get it to connect wirelessly or with usb. Went through the Xbox website troubleshooting page and when I typed in the serial number, it said it couldn’t find the number. Now I’m having to try to get Xbox to replace it. Not a good product, or a working one.",negative
BEST VERSION YET!,5.0,"Fantastic ergonomic beast of a controller? Absolutely yes! I have always enjoyed the original XB1 controller, even with my small hands, I could get a comfortable wrap around it, with the new XB SERIES X version, it’s slighter smaller and more refined, I absolutely love it, I don’t see myself using my previous XB1 controllers anymore. Lol! The color is stunning in person. I recommend buying black thumb grips to give it a better look!",positive
Poorly Cared,2.0,"The packaging was just god awful. The papers that were within was damaged and the controller itself was dusty and had to be wiped clean. For the controller itself this version feels nicer than the others however the D-Pad is noisy as all hell. I would love a replacement and hope they do better the second, but I just do not feel like waiting nearly another month.",negative
Controller died faster than my last goldfish,1.0,List of things that last longer than this controller:1. Relationships in 90 Day Fiancé2. Goldfish3. Hamsters4. Almond Milk5. Sleepy Joe’s attention span,negative
Sharp Looking,5.0,"Great replacement. Only used the stock controller for about 4 years before the mic jack starting having issues in party chat so diagnosed it to be a controller problem, and decided to just snag a new one and this color wave looks sharp. Also like the textured back grip and triggers also have the texture as the original controller did not so I really like this one.",positive
Feels great,5.0,"Had my old controller going bad on me so I needed a new one. This controller has a textured grip on the sides that I absolutely love. Feels great in my hands, and the color design is pretty cool as well. Good controller to get.",positive
Wireless battery doesn’t attach!!,2.0,Not compatible with the wireless batteries. It’s not in the same shape and the tabs to insert it are different. Really bummed. I hate changing batteries. Are the wireless charging stations and batteries changing from the ones I bought in March 2020. Totally bogus!!! Not happy.,negative
Great buy!,5.0,I love this controller because the bottom of the unit has a griping rough surface. This helps with keeping my hands from sweating and making the controller slip. The controller works like the original equipment that came with the console.,positive
does not work with xbox one chargers for the dumbest reason,2.0,"They simply made the slots too narrow. they are there, just not wide enough. You have to assume if their engineers pooched that, they pooched the internals.  A poor product that didnt know its core audience. feels cheaply made as well.",negative
sucks loses pairing all the time,1.0,"Microsoft you can't get your own controller to work with your own operating system, and you want to be taken seriously for gaming. The controller looses BT connection every 10 minutes.  Problem has been around for years and MS does nothing.",negative
All the Blue,5.0,"Love the controller! Rubber on the sides and added texture makes for great grip!Blue buttons, d pad, Home button and a two tone swirl for the rubber grips.Definitely buy if you Love Blue.",positive
Best Xbox Controller Yet,5.0,"Great build quality - feels like one solid piece and there's no give or creaking when gripping tightly.  The additional no-slip grip surface on the bottom and triggers/bumpers gives this controller a great feel.  The rumble bumpers work terrific, too.  The only downside is that if you elect to go with a rechargeable battery setup, you'll end up having to ditch the matching white battery cover for the black one that the battery charger manufacturer provides to allow access to the rechargeable battery.",positive
"Looks great, plays great",5.0,"I pre-ordered this based on pictures I had seen. I figured it would not look as good when I received it and it would be a cheap controller. Wrong on both accounts. It looks wonderful. My friends really like the colors (so do I). The controls are smooth, and the rubber grip is comfortable and useful. It's not quite an Elite controller, but it seems better than standard. Somewhere in between.",positive
PIECE OF CRAP,1.0,"CONTROLL WILL NOT STAY STATIONARY. BOUGHT LESS THAN 3 MONTHS AGO NO WAY TO SEND IT BACK, XBOX JUST SAYES IN WARRANTY CHECK WITH WHO YOU OUGHT IT FROM RETURN ONLY 30 DAYS WITH AMAZON WILL PURCHASE FROM WILL NEVER PURCHASE FROM AMAZON AGAIN, WALMART.",negative
Sturdy and rugged.,5.0,"All our grandchildren have their own controllers so that they are the only one that uses it and there is no mixup in which controller belongs to who. The controller is sturdy and they all have their own place on the charging stations. Having their own controller makes them responsible for their own controller. If your controller is not charged or not put away, you have to wait until it charges or you can find it. With 5 grandkids in all different age groups it helps them learn about taking care of your stuff.",positive
Really Good for PC Gaming pretty easy to set up,5.0,"I recently bought a Gaming Laptop and I wanted to play with a controller, so this is why I get this Xbox One X Controller, since was the one supported by Windows. It was pretty simple to setup, you only need Xbox Accessories to update the firmware via USB C and have the latest update of Windows installed. I read some comments about needing an extra Xbox wireless adapter BUT if you have Bluetooth you can set it up like a I did, no adapter needed.",positive
Only buy it on sale. Previous version better.,3.0,Fine after firmware update (on pc download the Xbox accessories app and plug in with usb c not included). The texture on the back is very uncomfortable and the d pad is outrageously loud. I recommend the previous Xbox controller. There is no advantage to this one unless you get it cheap.,neutral
Great controller,5.0,"This controller works great for my XBox one. My original controller the Right button above the trigger didn’t work anymore but this one is great. The shipping was fast, packaging was real nice & protective. Would recommend anyone to buy.",positive
First impressions are great,5.0,"My boyfriend absolutely loves the grips that this controller has on it, the last one we ordered only lasted about two months so fingers crossed this one is better, I’ll definitely update the review in two months",positive
It disconnects while gaming,2.0,"The controller looks fantastic and I was so excited about its arrival, only to find out that it randomly disconnects for 10 seconds at a time. 👎",negative
DAÑADO,1.0,La caja vino destruida y el control no funcionaba. No se puede devolver porque tarda mas tiempo y cuesta mas el envio que el control.,negative
Beautiful controller,5.0,"Besides the box coming in a little beat up, the controller it’s self was in great condition. While all I can say is the controller works like normal, you’re getting this for the color, it’s beautiful, nice and has kind of a sparkle to it, the rubber grips on the handles are a very nice touch as well.",positive
It works,4.0,"I got a free XBone. Even if qi decided to sell it, I kind of needed to pick up a controller. This was as cheap as I'd find something official. It has a nice, weighty feel and is very responsive.",positive
Perfect!,5.0,"I bought a silicone cover for it, but perfect condition!",positive
Problems already!!!,3.0,"Was very excited for a new controller as the one I got with my Xbox was starting to have issues as a  4 year old controller would, not 4 months after getting this one i started getting really bad joy stick drift and controller lag. I don’t play that often as I don’t have time, mostly play cod and battlefield, and I know some of you will think “oh it’s cause you play cod and have the joystick smashed in”, but the fact is it only lasted 4 months before it started having problems.",neutral
Mediocre.,3.0,"So far so meh... controller keeps disconnecting randomly while I play, looks like I'm not the only one with that issue and Microsoft is aware of that. Also looks like that's Microsoft's way to sell their crappy $25 adapters. Will update if I'll find a solution (without an adapter).",neutral
Very durable products. Don't waste your money on XBOX knockoffs.,5.0,Don't buy knockoffs of XBOX products. Just buy the real deal and you'll have a long lasting controller.,positive
No cable in the box.,1.0,Does not include a USB-C cable. For this price it should include the cable. Seems fine otherwise but I will not give it a good review - Microsoft should know better.,negative
Best Xbox controller design so far,4.0,"Sturdy, fits large hands well, and feels good to use. Only gripe is that the mechanical 'clicks' of the buttons are quite loud compared to older controller models, like using a mechanical keyboard versus a standard one.",positive
Stopped Working,1.0,"Well. I woke up today, and my controller will no longer sync to my xbox. I have tried everything I can think of. Iv done all the troubleshooting steps, and still nothing. I can no longer return my order as it is past the 3 month mark. so I have a nice paper weight to add to my desk. very unhappy that after just 3 months the controller is useless.",negative
It works...,4.0,"A bit pricey for what it is, a standard Xbox controller. No bells, no whistles, it just works.Can only imagine these are churned out by the thousands in a Chinese factory at minimal cost. Lets pass those savings on Microsoft!",positive
Right stick broken after 2 months.,2.0,"The right stick moves up constantly.I dealt with it for a few weeks already and bought another controller again, but on the new one the A button got stuck the very first time I plugged it in for updating the software on it. I think these cheaper models are total crap. Unfortunately, it’s probably better to spend more on a decent controller. Microsoft hardware has gone to hell.",negative
Defective,3.0,"At first glance, I really liked the controller. Felt well made and fit nicely in my hands. After playing a bit with it though, I noticed that right on the D pad takes a lot of force for it to register so it’s very aggravating when I need to press it. I’d like to exchange it for another remote but it’s all out of stock on Amazon right now. If I’m able to exchange it in the near future I’ll update the review.",neutral
Fits good in my man hands,5.0,"I use this to connect to my Alienware M17 R4. Works in Xbox game center and EA Play. No complaints at all. I'm typically a kb and mouse gamer, but when I need a controller, this fits the bill just find and dandy.",positive
Meh,2.0,"It has a weird texture on it, I’m assuming to help with your grip but it feels gross for lack of a better word. Also I can’t connect the cord I have connected to every other Xbox controller I own because it requires a different cord.",negative
Kid loves it. Hate the battery drain.,4.0,"I bought this extra controller for my kid's xBox gaming exploits so that she may share the joy of gaming with her sister. It works like a charm. Her specific commentary did mention that the 'buttons are loud', and the batteries die quickly. I purchased separately some rechargeable batteries so as to help lessen her impact on the environment.",positive
Works great after updates.,4.0,"Had a little trouble keeping it connected until I ran updates from my PC. Other than that, it works great. The only thing I'd change is the texture of the grips. It feels pretty abrasive after not too long.",positive
Dope as heck,5.0,First off absolutely stunning controller second off the controller grips and triggers as well as rb lb are all textured and it allows me to grip the controller better and feel like I have well better control over it overall extremely happy with my purchase just make sure you have a usb-c cable with a standard input for your Xbox or else you will not be able to update the controller,positive
Risky and not good quality,2.0,Box came severely damaged. I thought I purchased a new controller but the box look like wolves ripped it open then put it back.Controller looks new but disconnects frequently from the Xbox with the message “please reconnect controller”. I know the battery is fine since I use a rechargeable pack that I switch between active controllers. Risky purchase if you think you are buying new. I feel like I got a factory reject.,negative
Great controller if you want to lose your BF,5.0,I bought it as gift for my boyfriend. He opened the box and starting talking about how great it was. (It’s a very pretty blue and feels really cool and light). He started using it to play his Xbox one and now I can never get any of his attention. It’s battery operated but the battery will last for HOURS. My point is if you want to lose your BF get him a controller.,positive
I love it,5.0,I love the color of this control. The texture is nice. The only thing I don’t like is that the battery cap has changed and cannot be used on the battery charger I had. I’m not sure why it was necessary to make this change.,positive
"Imagine using an Xbox one controller, couldn’t be me",5.0,This controller is so much better than the original. It’s perfect. If I had a PS4 I would literally sell it to my grandmother just so I could experience the glory that is this Xbox controller.,positive
"Nice, solid controller, but the Bluetooth support seems iffy",3.0,"I like the feel of this controller, it's an all around decent controller. However, I got this one with hopes of hooking it up to my bluetooth adapter, and when that didn't work I bought a second one. That one seemed to work alright, but I've noticed technical quirks with it that make it unpleasant to play with some games, i.e. detecting 2 controllers instead of 1, and just all around misbehavior. I'm going to now buy the Microsoft Wireless adapter to see if it works better.",neutral
Limited life span.,3.0,I have purchased 2 of these controllers and got 1 out of the xbox series x console box. All 3 had a life span of 2 - 4 months. All 3 of them had left toggle drift and various buttons sticking. Waste of money doesn't even begin to describe this purchase,neutral
good controller,4.0,using this on a pc we've not had the random disconnect issues that we'd had with the xbox one controllers so thats been great.  so far theres also not been any weird drifting issues.,positive
Didn't last 4 months -,5.0,"The left joystick broke within the first 4 months, and haven't been able to use it since. Don't know if there is any type of warranty or anything but basically 70 bucks lost and it didn't even last a year -",positive
The Texture is amazing,5.0,didnt realize this was a Series controller thought i was buying an one controller and omg the subtle changes are amazing the texture and grip is great the triggers feel amazing and the dpad seems 100times better,positive
It’s an Xbox controller,5.0,"It’s an Xbox controller... got it got my pc and it works great, but recommend Microsoft dongle for using the Xbox controller. All in all it is exactly what I needed but took way too long and wasted $$ on too many cheap knockoffs. This works as intended with zero problems",positive
Awesome design,4.0,For now I can say is it looks nice I have not used it yetAlso I can’t properly post an honest review because I get reprimandedI forgot we lost the power of freedom of speech,positive
Defective,1.0,Connecting this controller to pc using Bluetooth is a breeze however my controller is completely ineffective it just disconnects and reconects every ten to thirty seconds rendering this controller useless for a pc laptop because it doesn't work,negative
Perfect,5.0,The new controller is so much better. The overall grip is better. The share button is a good addition.In all my previous gen xbox controllers the trigger buttons made a squeaky noise but that’s not the case with this one.,positive
Wouldn’t connect with Apple TV,5.0,I purchased this for our grandson so he could play on our Apple TV.  This controller would not connect via Bluetooth to our latest version of Apple TV.  We traded this one with our son who has an older version Apple TV.  He’s good with it.,positive
DO NOT BUY!!,1.0,"Gave to my 18yr old as a Christmas gift. Bought Dec 17, but when contacting Microsoft tonight (May16) they said it is out of warranty for 6 days. Controller won't recognize when it is on the charger. Just bought a brand new charger tonight, thinking that was the problem & no, it's the controller. Lots of other reviews similar to this one..... would NOT recommend buying!",negative
Stops working after a few months,5.0,The controller was great for the first couple months but now it drifts terribly and glitches really bad. Can’t even select options on the main screen without it glitching. I also have a sister who ordered the same one around the same time and it is having the exact same issue. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. I also have no way of returning it or getting a replacement now which stinks.,positive
Working OK,4.0,"Works well but I think on any of these Xbox controller the thumb sticks don't last long, at least for adult users. I have strong hands so the thumb sticks usually only last 4-6 months",positive
Not what I was hoping for.,1.0,"Not a true Microsoft controller for the Xbox One. Maybe I missed something in the description.  The charging port on it requires some mystery cable I’ve never seen before and it didn’t come with one. Controller has some extra share button. Doesn’t feel like my Microsoft controller. The charging packs that fit my current controller do not fit this, the battery area is a different shape. Overall, very disappointing.",negative
"Stick drift and just got it July 10th,2021",1.0,"I thought I was in love with the controller until a week ago random buttons started being pushed on screen. But it was small nothing too major. But now a week later the sticks are drifting, try playing a diamond rank game and you just start looking up in the middle of a shootout. I’m highly disappointed. I’ve had my original Xbox controller for 7 years and it just started doing stuff like this. I want my money back.  I believe I paid for a warranty but I don’t know how to redeem it. I need a new controller",negative
Shuts off and then it turn on during matches,1.0,"Do not buy. The controller was shutting off and turning on during COD matches during waiting time. I have downloaded and updated the controller and did not fix the issue. One match, I drifted to the left and could not move at all.",negative
"Box came really damaged, but the controller is great!",4.0,"I bought this to replace my old Xbox one controller, and it does just that. It works great, highlight of it is that it finally has USB-C. No more poor connections, but was a bit worried because mine came in a really damaged box... Sadly! Luckily is wasn't broken or damaged, unlike my Xbox Elite series 2 that i had to return. One complaint is i wish it had a internal rechargeable battery like the PS5, i hate having to buy battery's. Hope this review helps :)",positive
"Great controller, lacks durability",2.0,"I've been using this controller since June 2021, it's now the end of August 2021.  The right bumper has stopped working 1/10th of the time, there is stick drift on the left stick.I do enjoy the feel of the controller, but it lacks durability to be a great purchase.",negative
Flawless Controller.Doesn't need a USB adapter,5.0,Read other reviews and they are not consistent with my experience. If you have a Windows 10 PC it connects and works flawlessly over bluetooth. Used for a few hours now and no issues. Don't waste money on the adapter. This controller is just better in every way compared to the previous generation xBox controller. Highly recommend it for PC.,positive
Great improved design!,5.0,"I love this color, the ""new"" design is great it feel grippier, I love the trigger grips and the clickiness of the d-pad and bumper buttons, overall a great improvement over the Xbox One Controller, I can't wait for design lab to come back.",positive
Very comfortable and clicky,5.0,This is the best controller I have ever held and is a joy to play my PC games with. Playing games for long hours and my hands don't hurt or feel like it's holding weights after a while. Connected to my previous Xbox One Wireless adapter with no issues. Love this controller.,positive
"Was great! Until, of course….",2.0,"Got about a month of use from the controller working good as new, and after a month and a half of light to moderate use, I can no longer go directly up on the left joystick. Seeing as I play VIDEO GAMES, I like to go FORWARD in whatever game I am playing so it makes it extremely difficult to do that. Would give 1 and 1/2 stars, but it rounds up. Highly disappointed. Looks cool though.",negative
Knock off??,1.0,What a piece of crap! Thing keeps disconnecting and reconnecting on its own so I can’t play any games. Will be returning so if it goes well o will be changing the one star review. Do not buy!! Get one from an actual retailer!!,negative
Constantly disconnects with xbox one console,1.0,"I had hoped for 100% compatibility with the XBOX one wireless controller. It's not exactly interchangeable with the XBOX One Wireless controller. Some software may not work, even on Windows 10.It pairs with iOS, but it didn't response at all for any games. Awaiting support for this controller on iOS.",negative
Faulty,5.0,Bought this approx 6 mths ago and it is already not working correctly. When playing a game your person will be standing looking straight ahead.  Then he just starts looking up till it goes all the way up and you are staring at the sky. So basically paid $10 a month for a controller.,positive
Poor quality,1.0,I have only had this controller for 5 months not played everyday and it just feels cheap and the y button keeps getting stuck. So its unusable. I took it apart to see if it needed cleaned but everything looks good it just wants to stick. Plus the vibration went out on it about 2 months ago. Xbox and asking high prices and making the quality of the stuff so cheap where you have to keep buying controllers and stuff like every other month. Poor quality for sure.,negative
Better and cheaper,5.0,Arrived on time. The box was a little dented but nothing to major and the controller works exactly as it should looks almost brand new and it's cheaper then the one s controllers it's a steal. I will be buying from this company again,positive
Xbox Core Controller - Robot White,4.0,"The Xbox Core Controller - Robot White was so easy to connect I couldn't believe it, put the battery in press bluetooth b4 u know it it was connected just like thatConnect to my Amazon fire tv to play the Amazon games",positive
"It worked at first, but has a dead left stick",2.0,The Left Thumbstick after less than a year is non responsive and in calibration tests appears to stick and not register movement while the right stick functions normally.,negative
"Functional controller, unpleasant aesthetics",2.0,"I'm disappointed with the quality control of Xbox, my controller has a gap between the battery cover and the controller itself and it makes some noises when pressing it. It's functional, but it doesn't look and feel quite good. Didn't expect this from a 60$ controller. And since I don't live in the US and bought it while I was visiting, I can't return it and have no other option than accept this flawed product :(Buyer, expect quality control issues.",negative
It’s an Xbox Controller,4.0,"Not much to say really. It’s an Xbox controller, it feels good in your hands and does it’s job. I’ve only had it for probably a month and I’m having issues with the headphone Jack when I plug in my headphones.",positive
"BROKEN, DO NOT BUY, I HAVE 2",1.0,"Thought I was getting a normal Xbox one controller, got my second one of these broken pieces of poop. Disconnects constantly. Within 30 seconds. Watching a cutscrne? Disconnected, actively pushing buttons? Disconnected. Sometimes you even have to remove the batteries to get it to reconnect. DO NOT BUY. I have 2 of them, different colors. BOTH DO THIS FROM DAY 1",negative
"Great little improvements, overall don't replace your old ones unless you need to though.",5.0,"After soldering and resoldering new joysticks to revive my stick drift controllers until I overworked the contacts, I decided it was time to just break down and get a new one. The new texturized grips on the triggers and hand grip are a very welcome improvement and feel wonderful compared to previous models, and the type c option is BEYOND overdue at this point microsoft... but you did and I'm thankful. If your controller isn't broken though, it's not a very big improvement.",positive
Triggers Failed within a week,1.0,"I have been an avid gamer all my life and have owned all consoles. The new Xbox Series S/X controller is exceptionally disappointing and somehow feels much cheaper than it's previous gen counterpart. I purchased this with high hopes and I am sad to say that I am bitterly disappointed. Not only is it bad, but it's triggers started sticking within a week. I don't think I have ever had a controller fail within a week on me. This just goes to show the shoddy craftsmanship. Please guys amd girls, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.",negative
Quality issue,3.0,"Although the controller itself appears to be well made, the docking station that works perfectly with my stock xbox one controller won't work with this one because the locking tabs on the battery pack do not line up the Same.",neutral
No cord and faulty wireless,1.0,"You can't buy a cord with one of these and the cord to connect it is a 3rd party peripheral, on top of which the bluetooth is faulty and constantly disconnects during gameplay.  Bad design choices and it doesn't even work properly.  I'm thinking of returning this.",negative
Great So Far,5.0,"The controller is super nice with all the new touches, like the grip texture and capture button. My bf plays video games a lot and so far there have been NO issues at all with the controller. We have an Xbox One.",positive
The controller operates well but constantly disconnects,1.0,The controller itself works just fine. Good updated controller.  But mine is constantly disconnecting and reconnecting over and over. Unless I'm in the middle of playing a match of something. Otherwise most menus and random stuff it just turns off. Left trigger also did have a piece break on it right away and I had to jam scissors down there to fix the part.,negative
Works as expected,5.0,Had a hard time connecting it at first but it was an easy fix. Took a lil time to get used to it not being color coated (I play 3 separate consoles lol) but it's a great controller,positive
The controller excellent,4.0,"I love the product, however be warned when you purchase Microsoft gives a 14 day game pass, don't trust the one that game with mines was ""already used"". I never activated it. 😏 Not cool watch your staff people.",positive
Garbage. Not worth it.,1.0,"Controller is trash. Tried to exchange it, they tried sending me to Microsoft to get a replacement and the link didn't go to the right place. Huge waste of time and money. I give it 0 stars",negative
Fits Great,5.0,"This controller glove installs easily and fits the best of any I've used, and it doesn't feel awkward on the controller.  It protects my controller from drops and getting dirty, so I highly recommend this controller glove.",positive
Sucks,1.0,This POS died after 6 months of light usage (I don't often game with a controller.) Won't work with USB or bluetooth. Now I know why their warranty is only 3 months.,negative
Functions MOSTLY as intended,4.0,"I play a lot of Final Fantasy 14. For some reason that game detects this controller as ""Bluetooth LE XInput Device"" and not an Xbox Controller. This means the controls are all wrong for that game unless you run it through Steam to automatically correct the controls. It works just fine for almost everything else though. Strangely I did not have this issue with the previous generation of xbox controllers. Also the triggers have more tension on this generation which can lead to hand fatigue after long play sessions.",positive
Such great quality!,5.0,"I got this as a gift got my husband and he absolutely loves it! The texture makes a great addition so it does not slip as easily. The colors are just as vivid as I had hoped, and do not even get me started on the new D pad. It has already survived a few falls with no damage at all. Will defiantly buy again, maybe try a new color :)",positive
Ehh,3.0,It feel like it was made with cheap parts. I've been using an xbox controller since 360 on pc. Compared to my last controller xbox one controller. I don't see anything new other than a new share button?,neutral
Microsoft is master of game pad!,5.0,"I use 5 ~ 6 game pad usually. (Ps4 dualshock, switch pro con, joy con, third part controller for switch)X box controller is best controller ever for me.1. Best grip experience2. Best rumble motor3. Best size4. Best weight5. Easy to change battery (external battery)6. Good location thum stickDo not hesitate! Just buy it",positive
Its Ok but...,3.0,It's nice but the fact it took forever to arrive and now has issues recognizing rechargeable battery packs is annoying. I specifically use rechargeable as they always lasted longer in my old controller but now my controller has issues turning on regardless of battery,neutral
Solid controller,5.0,Originally bought a cheaper generic brand but soon realized it was not very responsive and was even discontinued being sold on Amazon. Go figure! You can't beat Microsoft XBOX controllers. Reliable responsive durable comfortable.,positive
Legit but not discreet,2.0,Comes in an xbox controller box not in discreet packaging. Got stolen and they still sent in same package. Good legit controller but very easily spotted and stolen.,negative
"Great controller, comfortable, quality build",5.0,"I use this with my PC games via Bluetooth. It's very comfortable and responsive, with a great build quality. Also works on my Xbox One S. White design very pleasing as well.  Highly recommended for PC/Xbox One/Xbox Series gamers.",positive
Easy husband gift!!,5.0,"Husband wanted a new controller for Christmas and when I read the reviews on this one, I knew I had to get him this one. It’s super easy to connect and share recordings when your gaming. It’s such a super cool feature.",positive
Right trigger sticks after about a week and a half of use.,1.0,Apparently they didn't design the right trigger right.  The right trigger began to stick not long after I got it and it made the controller basically useless for games like Rocket League.  Replaced it with a warranty through Microsoft and the new one they sent me did the same thing after a bout a week and a half.  Don't waste your money if you play RL or any racing games.,negative
Gooood!,4.0,Bought this for my 17yr old. I think he may go through batteries quickly but I guess that happens when the batteries are dollar batteries. My 1yr old dropped this in the toilet a week after getting this. After drying it out for a day it still works surprisingly. So far it’s holding up no issues. It’s worth it I guess!,positive
It's a controller,3.0,"Got it right out of the box and tested the feel of the controller. The usual just press all the buttons and move the sticks to see if there was sticky buttons or stick drift. In that testing the 'X' button stuck, so I played around with it a little more and it won't stick if you hit it just right. The same reason I bought a new controller, needing to hit buttons 'just right.' Now its a different button. It works just fine except the sticky button.",neutral
Perfect Replacement,5.0,"My original Xbox one controller started breaking down on me. This was a great replacement for it. Love the simple color scheme - mainly white with black accents. It looks great with the thumb grips I got as well. It’s also a bit textured, which makes it sturdier to hold. This controller overall feels durable. I’m hoping it’ll last for a while.",positive
Best Remote,5.0,We go through at least 2-3 remotes a year. This one has lasted us the longest and still going strong! Best Remote according to a teenager that plays games 24/7!,positive
Great Controller,5.0,"I purchased this controller for use in my Tesla and it works great. No need to say more. But, for those wondering, you do not need the batteries in the controller if you're using the USB-C cable to connect it.",positive
Best controller I’ve gotten from Amazon yet,4.0,Before this controller I have order multiple “new” controllers. Some stop working or had button issues out of the box. A couple I’ve taken apart in an effort to fix and there would be visible signs that the controllers have been tampered with. This controller was going to be my last from Amazon but it works great. Had it for months now. Only issue I have had and random de-syncs here and there but other than that works great!,positive
New product not working,2.0,Controller worked great first hour after that kept freezing and or shutting off and restarting to where if have to remove batteries an install to fixTriedChanged the batteriesResyncingNothing is working and just bought these to replace non working originals,negative
Don't understand,3.0,I bought this because one of my controllers went bad. It was fine at first but then it randomly keeps disconnecting and reconnecting constantly while in playing a game. When I go to the home screen it works fine. I don't get it.Update: it works fine with a lot of my games but for some reason it keeps disconnecting when I'm playing AC Valhalla. That just doesn't make sense.,neutral
Fun!,5.0,"My son loves, loves, loves this controller! He is 24yrs old but still a little kid at heart.",positive
Bumpers still terrible,1.0,"This is my 3rd controller with a broken bumper, this time after only 4 months. My 24 year-old N64 controllers still work great with exponentially more hours on them. Unbelievable that the design and longevity of these controllers continues to be so bad despite the Xbox One being out for over 8 years. Everything else about the controller is great but the poor reliability is unforgivable.",negative
my nephew loved it,5.0,"I don't use it personally, but I will say that my nephew loves it. I bought it as a gift to replace his wired controller. He has nothing but great things to say and I have yet to see him more excited about a gift.",positive
Pretty except the white color on the whole backside.,4.0,"4 stars only because they don’t show you that underneath it’s actually white. I was hoping it would be all one color, blue. But my husband is a huge Duke Blue devils fan so he didn’t mind the white much.",positive
Nice grip and great controller,5.0,"Love the new Xbox style controller, seems to have a better grip than older models, only wish that it was rechargeable instead of having to use AA batteries.",positive
Great but still drops out,4.0,"Works great, but it does drop out occasionally then blink and come back, really fun when you’re getting attacked in a game and can’t do anything. I don’t believe in Bluetooth so I use a dongle on Windows.",positive
Buy a USB-C cord with this controller.,4.0,"Controller works great but as soon as I connected it, I had to do an update that required a USB-C cord. Guess what is not included; a cord.So buy a USB-C cable just in case.",positive
Very unhappy - They changed the design to limit 3rd party accessory options,1.0,Microsoft changed the design to limit 3rd party accessories from working with it. They moved the contact points for battery packs so all older designs no longer work. Am considering returning it and getting a pair of 3rd party controllers - had the original controller swiped. I am again disappointed with Microsoft.,negative
Surprisingly different,5.0,My son loves this controller. He said that I have upped his xbox game since I hot it for him. He likes how lightweight it is compared to the traditionally controller and he like the grippers on it.,positive
Terrible broken controller,1.0,Microsoft makes some of the worst controllers ever. My Elite controller started falling apart after a few months of use and this one proved itself to be unusable during the very first play session. The right trigger is sticking to the point of unusability and it frequently will turn itself off/lose connection. Ridiculous. I'll never buy another MS-made controller ever again. Terrible quality control.,negative
Awesome Xbox controller 🤘🏼,5.0,"Last week I had a can of coke and by being abruptly unconscious my silly self spill it on my controller now my “x,y,b and a” buttons are sticky and nagging to press firmly now, any way on going about this with getting it to proper Specs",positive
Bluetooth doesn't work on Windows 10,1.0,Xbox Accessories app recognizes controller but hangs at 0% forever when trying to update firmware. Without firmware update controller never comes up in Bluetooth pairing screen. Returning and looking for an alternative until Microsoft sorts out their spaghetti code.,negative
35$ of happiness,5.0,"The best gamepad I've ever owned. Buying it for $ 35 on Black Friday was the best solution. The only thing I didn't like was its ability to work only with the latest versions of Windows. And FIFA is also doubling down on the controller. It is treated very easily. First, start the game, and only then turn on the gamepad.If you are still in doubt about buying, then Sony sucks, the level of which is a Chinese basement. Logitech is much better.",positive
HORRIBLE,1.0,"The controller felt nice at first with the texturing and etc, but when I started moving the sticks around, they would not center properly. The stick would just bounce around its ""center zone"" and would not return to the exact center. Furthermore, the right shoulder button does not press properly. It felt too light; lighter than the left shoulder button. Overall, this controller is horrible. The packaging was damaged like crazy, like if the deliverer drop kicked it 20 times over.",negative
So far so good...,5.0,Really like this my old one got juice split on it by my son and I love the color red so I got this one it's so much better and I like that thier is a button to take screenshots,positive
Charging wire,3.0,"Straight forward controller, it works and is comfortable.  However, if you intend to use a previously bought rechargeable battery, you will need a new USB C cable.  The controller doesn't accept the typical USB power cable and does not come with the new type of cord.  It should.",neutral
"Great, but…",5.0,"Great, but the shipping sucked. First time it arrived completely broken. The next still damaged but useable. It should be sent in a box not an envelope.",positive
Very disappointed,2.0,I bought the daystrike and the carbin black with the cord included. I tried the carbon black first (because best for last) it worked for about a week. Then one day it wouldnt turn on. I plugged it into the xbox. Not even a light or a vibration. All it would make is a high pitch whining noise. Then the daystrike camo. Worked for 2-3 weeks. Then the same problem. Very dissapointed. My friends have the same comtrollers and they all said the same thing... Very dissapointed xbox...,negative
Love it but…..,5.0,"Excellent controller love it, but this does use more battery then original controllers and will off and on disconnect from Xbox which is a serious pain is the a$$!",positive
It’s blue,5.0,"I love this blue colour, the buttons lighting and overall aesthetic... My favourite controller for PC",positive
works perfect with my xbox one console!,5.0,"it worked perfectly with my xbox one console. i synced it, it gave me an update for the controller, i updated, and done! it’s highly responsive, even more so than the original xbox one controller. it’s also a tad bit smaller than the original xbox one controller. i love the new d-pad & textured grip triggers/bumpers. it’s default share button is mapped to screen capture but i remapped it to video capture — awesome feature btw! overall, completely happy with it. aside from it being a little smaller, it’s a great improvement over the last series.",positive
Great controller but was having issues.,3.0,"The controller is very nice, definitely a step up from the Xbox one controller. Nice grips and textures on the back of the controller and triggers. Feels nice in your hands. But I’m using this controller on the Xbox One S, and for some reason the controller freezes up and I can’t do anything when I’m playing a game. I have to take out the batteries to unfreeze, it has happened to me a couple times already. It hasn’t happened recently and I hope this issue is just random.",neutral
Works great!,4.0,Love the controller no issues. Only reason why I gave it four stars is because I thought this would be the exact same controller that comes with the system. But it ended up working out in the end.,positive
really like the controller feel great in my hands and works well,4.0,really like the controller feel great in my hands and works well however its been a while and still no ios support which i thought would come sooner so sorta disapointing 4.5/5,positive
Controller does not hold charge,1.0,We have had this controller for 7 months and it no longer holds a charge.

By the right gear,5.0,This controller made a great addition to my Xbox series x easy to keep charged up charge usually last as long as I wanted to for my gaming purposes sometimes not... But all in all and can't go wrong with this one.,positive
Microsoft releases another terrible controller,1.0,"Much like their 200 dollar Elite Controllers, this one suffers from poor button registration. It's a 50-50 chance whether that A button you just pressed will actually register. Thanks MS.",negative
Pfff,1.0,Awful. Same cheap crap as last gen but this one barely latches Bluetooth. Useless.,negative
Can't use rechargeable batteries.,2.0,"Not happy... I have 1 controller that came with my Xbox, it takes rechargeable batteries. I ordered this very similar looking one thinking it would be the same... Nope! Can't use the charger and 4 rechargeable batteries i have already. Also the box looked like it had been opened before. I will not be using this controller, what a waste. I'm not happy at all with this.",negative
"X Box controller, works with X Box one X",4.0,Bought to replace controller that was going out. The d pad is noce compared to older versions. After market rechargable battery covers may not fit,positive
Perfect for PC Gaming Too!,5.0,"Bought it to play games on my Windows 10 Laptop. And works great. Easily plugs in and plays right out of the box. I use a Micro USB C cable because my laptop doesn't have bluetooth. I added a grip skin and analog grips as well for extra comfort, my hands get sweaty when gaming for a while.",positive
"Xbox Ultimate pass , that came with the controller was redeem by someone other than the purchaser.",5.0,"The Xbox Wireless Controller – Pulse Red was received in good condition , and working perfectly with my Xbox console. However ,  I notice that this product had came  with a  Xbox Ultimate pass for 14 days. However, I was unable to redeem the code for said number of days on my Xbox console. It seem the code was redeem already by someone other  than the purchaser which is unfair to the customer that had purchase the product.  So think amazon , need to look into this.",positive
"Works for xbox one, x, or s series consoles.",5.0,Exactly as described. We purchased for an xbox one console. It will work for an x or s series also. Instructions are for the x/s series to pair with console. Paired with our xbox one exactly as supposed to.,positive
Great controller,5.0,"This controller is as good as its supposed to be. All the triggers and analog sticks are smooth and just perfect. All the buttons work with no problem. This controller switches well between xbox and pc, no problem there. This is honestly my favorite control to play games with, and I play all sorts of games on my pc and xbox.",positive
Cool Color and decent battery life,5.0,Works great for both Xbox One and Series consoles. Keep in mind that if you have a play and charge kit for previous generation it probably won’t work due to slight changes in control shape/size for the new generation controllers.,positive
3 months of use and developed a drift already.,1.0,"I’ve had this controller for 3 months and it already has a drift and I can’t return it because Amazon only accepts products back after 1 month, my old Xbox one controller I’ve had for 3 years and still doesn’t have a drift or any problems just wear and tear on the overall look and design but not problems functionally there is no reason a brand new controller should develop a drift after 3 months",negative
dissapointed,2.0,"I've been using original xbox controllers for a while, I thought new wireless xbox controller would feel way better than my controllers build in 2002-2005, but nope this new controller doesnot feel any better, it feels like cheap chinese controller compared to those original xbox controllers, plus its on AA batteries, I think ps5 can bring much more fun",negative
Great controller,5.0,"Picked this controller on Cyber Monday for $39! Worth every penny. Very light controller, lighter then the standard xbox one controller/2nd generation. Very nice feel, very good rubberized grip as well. Recommend this.",positive
Just buy this and stop thinking about it already.,5.0,Now this could possibly be the coolest color controller on the market. This thing is so good looking. And of course the controller works as planned. It's from Microsoft and not a second tier brand or knock off. Love the new D-Pad and share button. If you are thinking of getting this color... JUST DO IT ALREADY.,positive
Great Color Scheme. Works perfectly.,5.0,The design is so nice. Got this for my wife. Want one just like it for myself but maybe in a forest green or Yellow in lieu of Red.So good. Works as expected.5* would recommend.,positive
"Long fingers/big hands, uncomfortable",3.0,"Gonna be honest, this is the worst(most uncomfortable) controller I own. I like how it looks, but my index finger tips go right past the triggers and don't comfortably rest on them like the PS4 controllers or Switch controllers. In order to actually press down on the triggers I have to bend them uncomfortably. If you have long fingers like I do, I would advise against buying this. Unless you really want it.",neutral
What do you expect when it's made in China,3.0,"First thing I noticed right when I opened the box for this controller is that it's made in China. Sad to say in the first two weeks of gameplay I've noticed the joysticks already beginning to wobble, I imagine it'll get worse. I'm sad because this controller feels so much better than the previous version. For context, I'm not a pro or regular gamer. Very casual on my part. And yet...",neutral
Disconnects regularly,1.0,"Bought for pc use. Bluetooth repeatedly disconnects. I updated the controller, but that didn't fix the issue. Unusable unless you enjoy dieing and or losing game progress.",negative
"Get it on sale, it is totally worth it!",5.0,"For the regular price, I'd say that PS5 controller is much better. However, if you can get it with a good discount (like $20 less), it will be the best controller ever. I love it, and it is pretty nice!",positive
Nice,5.0,"I don’t know about everyone else, but I have a Microsoft gaming pc with windows and it works without an adapter because I can just connect it to Bluetooth. It does not coming with the adapter so you’ll have to buy it separately, but it will connect to Bluetooth.",positive
Good grip,5.0,"Such an amazing controller. Grip all around from, the front to the back, all around. Even the triggers are gripped. Only annoying thing is the share button is constantly hit. Otherwise it’s 99% amazing !",positive
Disappointed,2.0,"I play rocket league daily and use my right bumper consistently, wearing out controllers in about 4-6 months. However, this controller lasted not even a full 2 months... It has been the quickest to break so far on me and I have been playing less as well so I’m a bit disappointed. Kind of cheaply put together Imo. I wouldn’t pay more than $30 for a controller like this. Going to purchase the original controllers instead one star for each month it lasted, and I’m being generous",negative
Great controller with grip!,5.0,"Great controller! The only thing I disliked was how the Y button is slightly harder to press than on the previous gen for some reason, but that might just be my controller.",positive
Awesome controller,5.0,"I have the original controllers from when the Xbox one came out, one of them broke and I needed a good replacement. I enjoy using this controller it’s solid and it works flawlessly.",positive
Instantaneous reaction speeds (latency) smooth,5.0,"Works perfectly. Reaction time seems far more instantaneous than the regular Xbox one controllers. Each trigger in Forza has its own unique vibration feel, for accelerate and deaccelerate. Buttons feel softer to press and feels comy in the hand. The record button makes it so much better to prove bragging rights 😉",positive
Sticking buttons and triggers.,1.0,"Very disappointed. Bought Microsoft product instead of other brand because they thought it'd be better. First one I got had a trigger that stuck if you held it down for an extended period of time, like 5 seconds or more, so I returned it for another one. The replacement I got is now having the issues with the X/Blue button sticking. Have only had it 2 months. Will try another brand next time, this is ridiculously.",negative
"Box came in ""meh"" but product intact",3.0,"The product itself looks to be fine however the box was destroyed and taped up (it was opened) All of the materials seem to be intact like manuals, batteries, and the controller (which was dusty for some reason). It connected fine, however I will be using the controller for the next few days and test it to see if there aren't any problems. I could care less about the box as long as the product is fine in which case I would be more than happy to change the rating.",neutral
"Controller is fantastic, but,",2.0,"I got the controller July 24th and it came with a 14 day free trial of gamepass ultimate, I tried to redeem it last night and it said it was redeemed already when I have not shown anyone it or anything. After contacting Xbox support they told me the code was redeemed may 19th...... Two months before I even got the controller, my only conclusion is that an Amazon employee swiped my code at the shipping factory. Other than this the controller is great 👍🏻",negative
Dont be retarded like me,5.0,I got this thinking I could have a 3 controller and I do and it works great but it's not an xbox one controller you can use the charging pack with it I think it's the series x so be careful works great though still glad a I got it,positive
Do not buy this if you want to use it with a PC,1.0,The Bluetooth connection stability is so terrible.,negative
Your standard controller,3.0,"It’s your standard Xbox controller. But the one I received, the box was crushed and there was hair and lint all over the controller. I wonder if this was a return.... so controller gets four stars but I’m taking one star off because of the dirty “new” controller",neutral
Double input,2.0,Nice design and feels good in hands but A-button registers twice when pressed. This has ruined many slay the spire runs...,negative
Typical Xbox controller,1.0,"As per usual feels and works great for a week then slowly starts to wear out over a couple months, playing rocketleague definitely wears these controllers out",negative
Microsoft is honestly scamming me,1.0,"Hello. I have an original Xbox one and one day my controller would just randomly disconnect and reconnect so I spent my last bucks on a new controller. I get it and it has the same problem. I have spent hundreds of dollars on Microsoft products and half the time they don’t work. Apparently the only solution for this is to spend money on a new Xbox, but I don’t have a spare $1000 to spend on one of the new xboxes. I just feel like I should get my money back.",negative
Worst amazon experience,1.0,"I bought this intending it to take the place of my no longer usable controller. Upon opening, the controller itself was dusty, did not look new whatsoever, and once connected to xbox, after 15 minutes of setting up the bluetooth doesnt work. Very dissapointed",negative
Would not recommend this controller,1.0,The the controller has a bad latency on it. There a big delay when using the controller.  I pay a lot if first shooter game it does not respond fast when I move the joy stick.,negative
Torture device for your hands,3.0,Too small. Some how less grip despite being covered in uncomfortable sandpaper. The triggers are trash only thing I like is the d-pad wich I rarely use I just going to stick with xbox one controller this one is just bad,neutral
Not happy do better,2.0,Ordered this from Amazon as I had a white remote didn't suit my color scheme for my pc so I'm using that for an xbox. Got it today package was clearly not great ok I can deal. Open it and this dust wth. 😩 Not happy do better.,negative
Unsupported and poor connection strength.,1.0,This an awful controller for one simple reason. It disconnects over and over!Not to mention the fact that it fails to work at all as you would expect. It has Virtually NO SUPPORT!,negative
Bluetooth drivers suck for windows 10,2.0,"If you plan on using this with windows 10 please plan on dropping more cash for the wireless adapter because you will see no fixes or updates for the bugged drivers for PC.Do yourself a favor and buy another controller. Windows hasn't fixed the issues for almost a year. They aren't going to, they will lose sales on the adapters.",negative
Can I give this 6 stars?,5.0,"Such a HUGE improvement over the last generation controllers. Loved the core controller so much I bought another in pulse red for a few extra bucks. Absolutely love the design and functionality, it has greatly improved over the years!",positive
Mine has joystick buttons bruh? Get on my level,4.0,Bodacious blue controller fit for all you bodacious blue gamers. Get er done with in blue. Athe little joystick buttons are my own creation so be jealous of me peasants,positive
Not at all recommendable.,1.0,"Bought one, the ABXY buttons were sticking, and the left analog stick wasn't working properly. There was a powder-like residue coming from it. Requested a replacement, got the replacement, and the same issue occurred. Returned them for a refund.Went to GameStop instead to make sure I was getting a legit controller, got the Blue/White one, works just fine, no powder-like residue.",negative
Great Controller!,5.0,"This controller works great and has a great feel to it. I was a bit worried about it's slightly different shape from traditional Xbox 1 controllers when I saw it online but it worked fantastically.I had a brief issue where the controller would stop working for a second, usually during the most hectic sections of the RE2 remake on PC, but after doing some research and plugging in the controller via a USB cable I was able to update the controller and since then it works amazingly!",positive
Wireless Joystick,5.0,I use this item maybe three or four time and I haven't had any problem gaming on my Samsung Tab S7 plus I can recommend this purchase,positive
6 months and done,3.0,Bought one in March.. loved it. Bought another one in August as a backup.  The day the backup arrived the first one stopped working... floating sticks.. D pad skips everywhere.. might buy another backup and update in 6 months.,neutral
Only a controller? really?,1.0,"If you can manufacture a quality controller and include batteries, you can also include a wire AT LEAST. The USB I had was not controller friendly and the controller ended up rejecting the wire after one play-through. Quite disappointing. I have to wait yet another week for a separate USB wire to play with this controller. Very cheap move of you Microsoft. very cheap move.",negative
Do not purchase if playing a input heavy game.,1.0,"Average users who play FPS and RPG games will be fine on this controller, but anyone playing a input heavy game like Rocket League or a fighter will struggle to keep this in good working order longer than 1 month.  Micro movements on the analog sticks degrade rapidly, and stick drift is a common problem. A shooter with aim assist wont notice the issue, however input commands for Rocket League like half flips, double jumps, and air rolls are a serious problem.",negative
Feels good.  Looks good.,4.0,"Great controller.  Works as it's supposed to.  I only knocked it down to 4 stars because the buttons aren't colored as they would be on a traditional controller.  They still added colored dots which correspond, but for newbs, (not me) this might be a small challenge.Feels great and works great.",positive
Uhhhg.. wrong controller,1.0,I thought I was buying for Xbox one s… can use the USB-C charging cord that I already own.. no cords included… so I gave it to my nephew.. read the package closer people..,negative
As described,5.0,Great up grade. Thicker than original. Might not fit your charging cradle if your cradle charges from the top of controller. Was able to modify my charging cradle to widen it.,positive
AUDIO JACK IS DEFECTIVE,1.0,Shortly after the return date closed from Amazon the sound started cutting in and out.  Definitely not the usual Microsoft quality.,negative
Was wrong color but great controller,3.0,I order blue but got white. It works great. Happy with the controller. Just diapointed it was white not blue. I even think the blue cost more at time of ordering.,neutral
Xbox game pass por 14 dias 😄,5.0,"Me encanta, primer mando q tengo y todo funciona bien, excepto por los audífonos q no lo detecta por Bluetooth, el unico problema q tuve es por conflictos del driver de audio de mi placa base, lo desistale y puse los génericos de Microsoft y funciona bien el audio por el mando conectado por cable",positive
Great Feel but Cheaply Made!,2.0,"I bought one of the new generation controllers for my xbox one. It was great at first but I've only had the controller for two months and I'm already experiencing sticky triggers. The right trigger on my controller sticks when pressing on it with force, something you usually see after a year or two of usage. Really annoying and a disadvantage for any competitive player... I've seen numerous complaints about this online with absolutely no response from Microsoft, unacceptable!",negative
Received a used product.,1.0,I bought this expecting a brand new product. The box spoke alone for itself. The back of the controller also has scratches all over it. Will be returning.,negative
Stopped Working Within 6 Months,1.0,"This controller had multiple joystick malfunctions when I got it (would stick upwards right from the box, then wouldn't circle smoothly), but it resolved after a few weeks.Now, 6 months later, it keeps disconnecting from the Xbox at random. None of my other controllers or my Bluetooth headset do this, so it's not an issue with the console.",negative
"Controller is awsome, audio jack doesn't work",5.0,Love the light weight ergonomic feel. The colors pop. The STICK AND BUTTON reaction is quick and on point. The only issue is the audio jack doesn't work. I love the controller so much I don't want to send it back . Will buy the same one hoping the audio jack works love this controller,positive
Very good controller,5.0,"I love the controller , the feel is solid and color is really good , check pic , works with pc , nvidea Shield , and another emulator hardware like rabsberry pi",positive
Didn’t hold up to light playing,2.0,Cool color scheme. My kid loved it while it worked. Lasted one month until right joystick quit working a week out of return window.,negative
Good grips,5.0,"Good controls, surprising to have little “ sand paper grit stuff” in the toggles ( bumps in the plastic mold ) to reduce slippage-pretty cool",positive
Xbox one rechargeable batteries dont fit it.,1.0,Why in the world microsoft and xbox one batteries arent compatible is beyond me. Now i have a fortune in worthless rechargeable batteries that DO fit all the other xbox one controllers.,negative
doesn’t work,1.0,"wish I could give it 0 stars, disconnected from xbox during games every 15-20 seconds.",negative
Only good if you don’t use it,2.0,"Disconnects randomly.  Turns off randomly.  Occasionally just starts doing things on it’s own.  It very hard to play a game this way.  After the first month, the trigger was already sticking.  On the plus side, I do like the new screen shot button",negative
Would buy again.,5.0,Quality up and down. Great battery life. Feels immensely better than regular XB1 controller.Fits all XB1 peripherals. Audio port tight and responsive.,positive
Sent a used controller!,1.0,Are you kidding? I was sent a USED controller when I purchased a new one! This was a gift for my son's birthday! Way to RUIN his birthday. I am furious.,negative
Not a great controller,2.0,I'd skip this Xbox controller and choose a different one because the buttons stick on this one after only using it for 2 days,negative
Awesome product!,5.0,This is an awesome product and I would highly recommend it! Works great and comes with batteries! (They don’t last long if you play a lot though so you will need to buy more eventually!),positive
Works with pc,5.0,Happy to have a controller that uses usb c and I'm able to play games with it. Just be sure to update the software of the controller using Xbox app,positive
Damage  and not SEALED box,2.0,"The box was a mess and it was NOT SEALED, big no for me, the box was destroy, I tested the Controller and it works fine, but this was a present, so that box  ruined everything.",negative
Premature wear!,2.0,Controller joystick rubber wears down quick to expose plastic. Plastic is slippery making the controllar useless. All other features work well.,negative
Xbox wireless controller,5.0,I believe this wireless controller is much better than the one I had.  I can see where they have redesigned certain features of the controller.  This was a great purchase,positive
Dont work correct,1.0,B doest work!😭😭😭😭,negative
Save your money,1.0,It’s a really nice controller but I spent all that money for it to stop working like a month after I got it and the return date had passed like two days before and my money has now went to waste on a controller that has been in use for only a month. And they don’t have the IP option to contact the seller. In that month I maybe used the controller 5 or 6 times. And controller is expensive but it definitely is a cheaply made material.,negative
As expected,5.0,Love it and the color.Note: For Xlarge hands/Fingers the Triggers and Index Buttons need to be extended somehow!,positive
Great,5.0,"Feels great and works great. Had to do a software/firmware update. All you need a USBC to take care of the disconnects that happen. After update, no more issues.",positive
Worked great for a few months,3.0,Worked for a few months. I enjoyed the textured handgrips. Now the joystick registers that it's moving even when not touched.,neutral
Pretty awesome for pc games,5.0,It's A very good controller for pc games and xbox. Pricy as heck but since I can no longer buy athutentic Xbox 360 controllers oh well.,positive
It’s an Xbox controller that has bluetooth,5.0,It has Bluetooth so connects to pc without extra adapters. I prefer the sticks on the Xbox 360 controller but the texturized grip of this one is nice,positive
Good one,5.0,"My grandson asked for a new game controller for his birthday.  When he opened it he said, “oh wow!  This is a good one!”",positive
Worst remote ever. Never buy it.,1.0,It seems like Microsoft willingly makes controllers that wear out in a few days. I got this one for playing FIFA. After reading the reviews it felt like this controller is durable but that is not the case. I regret buying this and wasting my money on this one. Within a month of usage the left joystick button stopped working..To Microsoft: Please improve your controller quality.,negative
Drifts,2.0,I thought this was a new controller. It drifts and I can't play my games without the controller going wacko!! Very disappointing 😞,negative
Questionable quality control,1.0,"I bought the XSX version of this controller about a month ago and the left stick has horrible drift already, it's essentially unplayable. I never drop my controllers since I just leave them on my desk when I am done using them. I don't rage, I don't have death grip, I don't eat while playing, basically I have no idea what could have caused it. I am returning it later and ordering another one, hopefully it's not awful as well.(I'm not one to leave bad reviews, but 1 month? seriously? kind of makes me want a ps5)",negative
Garbage,1.0,"Didn't last a year even. Microsoft's warranty process is like dancing bare foot on broken glass. How does a 7 month warranty make sense? If you can't even warranty your product for 1 year, it must not be worth buying.",negative
Seems good so far but may be used?,4.0,The controller came with a product code for 2 free weeks of Xbox Gamepass Ultimate and when i tried to redeem it it said that the code had already been redeemed. Other than that the controller seems okay.,positive
Bad product,1.0,"Terrible product. Was a gift. Not used until 2 months after purchase because it was for Xmas. Broke in 3 weeks. Missed the return window. Now, stuck with a $50 defective item.",negative
Just stopped working one day.,1.0,"I love this controller so much let me start with that, it feels great in your hand, has smooth joysticks, it’s a great controller but mine for some reason just stopped working. It can connect to and turn on the Xbox but after that nothing works I’ve had it for a few months and now I’m out 60 dollars on a controller I actually loved. On the contrary a lifespan of a few months isn’t worth a controller at all.",negative
Top Notch Vendor!  Shop here first.,5.0,"The packaging had me worried, but it is working flawlessly. Bonus 🌟 for the included batteries. You are an excellent vendor.  I would gladly buy from you again.",positive
Buy your controller at a regular store,2.0,"Bought one controller from here a year ago and the A button would stick, brand new out of the box. Ok no problem stuff happens. Ordered the shock blue controller that just arrived today, same problem brand new out of the box, the A button sticks again and the controller came with a smudge on it that I can’t clean off fully. These have to be refurbished products or something, disappointed. Bring your business elsewhere.",negative
Great controller but buy it locally.,3.0,"The controller is great and is a big improvement from the Xbox One controller but this one I got had a defective LB button. The button works but requires it to be hit with extra force to register. Buy this at Walmart, Target, or wherever, where it would be easier to return and get a replacement.",neutral
Too Small,1.0,"I know they made the new series controllers a little smaller, but this controller just straight up doesn't fit in my hands... I have to almost use a bear claw grip just to get my fingers in the right positions. I'll be returning this controller and getting a ps5 duel sense controller instead.",negative
I recommend buying this product,5.0,"The hand is the Xbox One, which is very impressive in terms of comfortable use, as well as the wonderful blue colors",positive
Drifts to the left!,1.0,"Worked well for about a day, then started to drift to the left,,,,, finally just put it up and will use it for part!",negative
Headphone Jack Broken,1.0,"So, the headphone jack on the controller works, but when I plug my headset in, the audio quality is unbearable. The controller is also fully updated. I know it isn’t my headset, because I plugged it into another controller and it sounded fine. Unfortunately, when I finally did plug my headset in and found this out. it was too late to return. Now I’m stuck with this expensive broken controller. :(On the bright side, it’s pretty :/",negative
This remote is bullocks...,2.0,"FIRSTLY, the box was ripped on the side like someone tried to open it. Plus the remote looked like it had already been slightly used. And why didn't this thing come with any wires? That was weird. And Last, this trifling contraption can't even connect to Bluetooth. Very unhappy with this buy.",negative
Not happy,3.0,Came with scuffs white crap on it and the box looks like it's been opened before.... Pathetic that I've been waiting this long just to get something that was treated like garbage.,neutral
Very loud buttons on a quality controller.,3.0,The d-pad and A/B/X/Y buttons are JUST. SO. LOUD.  This is not a controller for discreet late night gaming.Otherwise it is well-made and has good ergonomics.  The micro dotted texture on the back of the handles and on the triggers is subtle and satisfying to hold.Matte white finish can get dirty easily.  Clean your damn controllers once in a while anyway you filthy gamers.,neutral
Defective,1.0,"This controller worked GREAT.... For about a week. I plugged it into my laptop after not using it for a day or so and now the triggers (both left and right) are totally unresponsive. I ran Xbox accessories app and it says the controller is up to date but when I test it, both l and r triggers read as if they are pressed in and won't snap out of it. I've looked for online fixes but found very little as this controller is pretty new.",negative
Great feel,5.0,I upgraded to this controller so I can do remote play on my iPad Pro and it worked perfectly. Also the new texture is amazing.,positive
One caveat,4.0,The controller itself is fine but the color is less pronounced in person.  The camp paint is very thin and looks like it’s gonna run off after a few plays.  Wish the colors were better,positive
Junk,1.0,Controller constantly randomly disconnects,negative
Not charger compatible,3.0,"In the description it said it was compatible with chargers but the battery I have won't fit this,so now back to buying tons of batteries once again.  Pretty disappointing.",neutral
Unreliable,1.0,"Worked great when it did work. After less than 3 months of moderate use, the Y button and left button aren’t coming back fully and requires more pressing to register the clicks. Supper frustrating to pay for a Microsoft brand controller and it last hardly any time at all. Would not recommend.",negative
Defective controller,1.0,"This item came used and although in good condition, the headphone Jack was damaged.  Even though I am very technical and was able to repair it. It should have never been shipped. As for the look and feel it is by far the best looking controller in the bunch.",negative
Great controller!,5.0,Texturing of controler hand grips and triggers make a big difference. Loved the new D pad. Joy sticks are more strategically located. Very nice updated controller.,positive
Damaged box,1.0,This controller is part of a gift. I was very annoyed to find that such an expensive controller would arrive in a beat up and ripped box. How embarrassing to present this as a gift!,negative
What you'd expect - almost,4.0,"Just recieved item. Genuine Microsoft item in factory packaging complete with box seals. Right out of box I noticed a scratch right down the face - not deep but visible. Not bad enough to warrant replacement but still a little frustrating. QC should have this type of blemish eradicated years ago. Assume item works correctly, going to pair with my computer this evening. If there are any functionality or longevity related issues I will update this review at that time.",positive
Does NOT work with call of duty mobile,4.0,This controller is not supported by call of duty mobile.,positive
I guess I got a lemon 🍋....,2.0,After 30 days it started messing up....  Disappointed ... Maybe that's why I was on sale and cheaper than all the others who knows...,negative
Must have!!!,5.0,"I love you and this controller is so perfect, I use it for my PC so it must be plugged. You would use USB-C cable when on pc",positive
Doesn't work with rechargeable bases,4.0,"I would have given it 5 stars but.......So maybe it's a little thing but, I have 2 different rechargeable battery packs and neither of them work for this controller. The 2 teeth(?) On the rechargeable battery itself are too far apart. The 2 slots on the controller dont match up with the so called teeth.So no choice but to use AA batteries unless I get a whole other rechargeable battery pack.",positive
Garbage,1.0,"The left thumb controller sticks in either the up or down position making accuracy difficult. The Y button also has been sticking as well. Just bought controller less than 3 months ago and it's already useless for playing, unfortunately it's just past the return date.",negative
Awesome controller.,5.0,"Ahh, i waited and yes its a pretty good controller.  In my opinion it worls better than my old xbox one controller love that the D pad changed.",positive
It's just ok.,3.0,"The letter buttons aren't very reliable when connected with Bluetooth; when you hold one down, it only registers briefly, very frustrating! Otherwise it's great.",neutral
Bright and baller,5.0,We’ve been on the hunt for new wireless Xbox controllers for a while. Then to find these bright like green ones??? Awesome.,positive
need update,3.0,"controller works lag via bluetooth and cant pair with usb bluetooth dongle on pc , if  it pairs is buggy, the controller needs an update as soon as posible",neutral
Great Color and Durability So Far,5.0,The red color is vibrant and nice. My bf plays video games a lot and so far there have been NO issues at all with the controller. We have an Xbox One.,positive
Didn't last 3 months,1.0,Bought this for Christmas. It worked great at first but of course it decided to quit after it was too late to return it. Very disappointing.,negative
works great for pc gaming,5.0,used this product to connect to my computer to play pc games on steam.  works great!!!,positive
"Does not work with PC games such as NBA 2k21, Fifa 21 and Rocekt League",1.0,"When connected to my PC via Bluetooth, the controller would not work with certain games. NBA 2k21 displayed weird button layouts and to press A I had to use the left dpad button and the right trigger was B. Very odd, and unfortunate because the controller is very well built and very comfortable to hold. Only one star for compatibility issues, other than that, it was a 5 star controller.",negative
Disconnects randomly while in use,3.0,Keeps saying controller is disconnected randomly while in use. Also the charging port is not the same as the old ones and I’m having trouble finding a cord.,neutral
"Original, authentic",5.0,Just what you would expect from an original Microsoft controller. Looks custom made and my son loves it.,positive

Excellent d-pad,5.0,"What a fantastic improvement over the previous Xbox One controller. Affordable, too.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it.",positive
"Good,  but one iasue",4.0,"Controller arrived on time and in good condition. Extra capture button on controller is great.

Grandkid loves it,5.0,"Works and has a somewhat different appearance and feel than the original controller. I like the original controller but the D pad on this is a tad bit more use friendly. Has a nice texture to it as well. I am by far no Gamer, but this was a cheap option to add extra players",positive
"This is perfect, dont let the product pics fool ya",5.0,I love it! It's got smooth grips like all xbox one x controllers have the front plate has a nice like plastic vinyl like feel and it just is a nice buy if you need a new controller; it did take about 9 days to get to me but worth the wait.

Bumper failed after 6 months.,2.0,"I use this controller only for casual Rocket League play, and the left bumper has failed already. It's become weak and unresponsive and has lost its click.

Unsurprisingly Solid,4.0,"My go to controller the last few years for my PC has been the Xbox One controller. The analog stick completely crapped out after a few years of abuse. Picked up one of these new ones to replace it. Feels nearly identical which definitely isn't a bad thing. Love the minor tweaks made though. Share button, textured back for grip, matte finish on the triggers, and the amazing new dpad are minor but great upgrades. One of my all time favorite controllers if I'm being honest.",positive
DIssapointing,2.0,"I've only had it a month and there is already stick drift on the left analog stick which keeps causing me to go forward on its own and for that matter the Y button is not as responsive and seems slow to spring back up.Although I do like the instant quick capture button, overall this was mostly a mistake to buy.",negative

That being said, The product was brand new All packing materials were there. And my order arrived between 1 to 6 days early the 10 seconds it took me to wipe it off was no big deal. If my package was open would have been five stars. That being said, Great product fast shipping great seller!",positive
Stick drift on all remotes,1.0,I have ordered multiple controllers on amazon.  Most recently xbox one x controllers. They have all had issues.  It was a reminder of why certain products are best not purchased on amazon.  Particularly most electronics.  Box stores also have a better return or exchange option.,negative
Upgraded,4.0,"The color is really nice. It takes screenshoots, it’s dual grip, you can share you gamer tag much easier. The controller even talks.

Not for me,1.0,The controller kept powering off in its own. I ordered a replacement and sent the bad one back. The replacement kept powering off on its own in the middle of games as well.

Nice controller,5.0,Hey this controller! Nice controller! Playable controller! Pretty controller! Buy controller!,positive
Wash your hands before using,4.0,"I would give this 5 stars, but the grips have a tendency to pull every bit of grit off your hands while playing.

Great improvement to older model!,5.0,"I love this controller. Needed a replacement for the original that came with Xbox One S. I got this because it will also work with the Series X when I get that.

Beautiful look and feel tho . 5 star just a bit sad I can't keep the Pulse Red Xbox Controller Box way to beat up.",positive
Absolute Garbage.  Shame on Amazon and on Micosoft for continuing to sell it.,1.0,What a total waste of money.

On the fence,1.0,A great feeling controller but for some reason it will randomly turn off and on which negatively effects my experience by either cutting out game audio or party chat audio on my wired headset. Maybe I got a faulty one because I've never had this issue in the past.,negative

Minor problem,4.0,So it would've been a full 5 stars but I realized while playing a game that pressing down on the thumb stick wasn't working. It's minor but it still sucks. Like 60 bucks for a controller that works but not all the way. Verrry cool 🙄,positive

Cheaply made and over priced,2.0,"Worked great for about 3 months and then all of sudden my thumb sticks are drifting. Kept in great condition didn't do anything to it, like throw it or something stupid. Cheaply made and paid way too much to have it be unusable in 3 months.

Does What It Should,5.0,"I bought this after the controller that came with my Xbox started drifting pretty badly, and it felt like a new system.  Haha.  The D-pad is a little cooler looking and it's USB-C, so make sure you have one of those as well. Buy it if you need it.",positive

Amazon Packing Disaster,1.0,"The one star is only because of Amazon's atrocious packing ability. The controller is somehow usable after the constant attack from a large box.

Good color and feels great in hand!,5.0,"My controller was old and dated, and the analog had drift. Bought this one and I love how it feels. Has grip on the back and everything feels awesome.

quality,1.0,buttons started sticking after only 3 months of use (usually controllers last me 2-3 years because i am very careful with them) from wear despite not using it much and the screws are a different size than any other xbox one controller i have used so i can't take it apart and repair any issues myself without buying new tools which has me annoyed enough to leave a bad review,negative

Poor response to analog stick inputs and poor button response.,3.0,Has a slight delay in response to input on analog sticks.. The accuracy is not very satisfactory and you gave to puch the buttons really hard to get a response. Especially the middle Xbox button.

Controller worked fine for 5 months then I started to have problems,2.0,"I have never been one to rage or throw my controller or harm my controller in any way.

Overall a nice controller,4.0,"I'm using the controller on the Xbox one X and overall it's a pretty good controller. I like the look and feel of it. One problem that I have with it is that sometimes it delays or it ""freezes"" on me. The delay goes away after I turn it off and on. As for the freezing, it takes a couple of seconds for it to go away. It doesn't happen often enough to be a problem. Still a pretty good controller.",positive
no cable or adapter included,3.0,this is exactly what I ordered and works well out of the box. what I dislike is why they are to cheap to include the usb cable to connect to a pc or the adapter for windows 10 whats the cost a mere dollar or two come on microsoft your better than that.,neutral
